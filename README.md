*Roland A. Knapp, Maxwell B. Joseph, and Thomas C. Smith*

This repository contains data, models, and a report/manuscript describing all antifungal treatments conducted to mitigate the effects of the amphibian chytrid fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* on mountain yellow-legged frog populations. 
These mitigation efforts were conducted in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks and Yosemite National Park during the period 2009-2018. 

The mitigation efforts include the following:
1. Treatment of young life stages with itraconazole in Barrett Lakes Basin (2009) and Dusy Basin (2010).
2. Treatment of adults with itraconazole in LeConte Canyon (2015) and Treasure Lakes (2018).
3. Treatment of metamorphs with *J. lividum* bacteria in Dusy Basin (2012).
4. Reintroduction of Bd-naive adults to South Fork Kings River (Upper, Ruskin, and Pinchot Basins) in 2013.
5. Reintroduction of adults from declining populations to Tyndall, Milestone, Pinchot, and Sixty Lake Basins in 2016-2018.
6. Translocation of adults from persistent populations in Yosemite. This summarizes the main results from the 2020 Yosemite translocation analysis report.

All sections (1-6) are included in a report ("Version 1") that was a required deliverable under U.S. Department of the Interior - National Park Service cooperative agreement number P19AC00789. 
Sections 1-3 are included in the manuscript **Effectiveness of antifungal treatments during chytridiomycosis epizootics in populations of an endangered frog** ("Version 2"). 

All raw data used in the analyses are in the `data` directory (see `README` file in that directory for details).
All R code to analyze the data are in the `R` directory. 
All R code and bibliography files to write the report/manuscript are in the `report` directory.
Stan code used to fit the LeConte CMR model is in the `stan` directory.
