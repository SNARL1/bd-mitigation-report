# Introduction {-}
Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly common in wildlife [@daszak2000emerging; @cunningham2017one], often due to anthropogenic changes in the ecology of the host or pathogen.
Impacts of disease on wildlife can be severe, including long-term population decline and even extinction, with far-reaching effects on species, communities, and ecosystems [@ostfeld2008infectious; @scheele2019amphibian].
Diseases of wildlife can also spill over to humans and domestic animals [@daszak2000emerging]. Collectively, these impacts of emerging wildlife diseases have significant consequences to global biodiversity and public health [@daszak2000emerging]. 
As such, the ability to control diseases in wildlife is critically important, but disease management is often difficult because wildlife diseases are relatively poorly described, many fewer intervention measures (e.g., vaccines) are available than for humans, and free ranging wildlife are inherently difficult to study and treat [@joseph2013taming]. As a result, available management strategies are mostly insufficient to mitigate the destructive effects of disease on wildlife.

The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis is caused by the chytrid fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (“Bd”). 
This recently discovered pathogen [@berger1998chytridiomycosis; @longcore1999batrachochytrium] is thought to have originated in Asia [@ohanlon2018recent] and spread globally via human commerce [@schloegel2009magnitude]. 
Bd is highly pathogenic to a wide range of amphibian species and, by one estimate, has caused the severe decline or extinction of at least 500 amphibian species [@scheele2019amphibian], and many more are predicted to be at risk [@rodder2009global]. 
In an effort to reduce the impact of chytridiomycosis, several mitigations have been suggested, including host density reduction, vaccination, and treatment with probiotics or antifungal drugs [@woodhams2011mitigating]. 
However, field tests of treatment effectiveness remain rare [@hardy2015itraconazole; @bosch2015successful; @hudson2016situ; @geiger2017antifungal]. 

Mountain yellow-legged (“MYL”) frogs are emblematic of global amphibian declines, including those caused by Bd. 
The mountain yellow-legged frog is a complex of two closely-related species, *Rana muscosa* and *Rana sierrae*, endemic to the mountains of California and adjacent Nevada, USA [@vredenburg2007concordant].
During the past century, MYL frogs have disappeared from more than 90% of their historical localities [@vredenburg2007concordant] and are listed as “endangered” under the U.S. Endangered Species Act [@usfws2002determination; @usfws2014endangered]. 
In the Sierra Nevada portion of the range, the primary causes of decline are the introduction of nonnative fish into naturally fishless lakes and streams and more recently, the spread of Bd [@knapp2000nonnative; @vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
MYL frogs are highly susceptible to chytridiomycosis, and the arrival of Bd in a naive population typically results in rapid increases in Bd prevalence and load, and subsequent mass frog die-offs [@vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
Such epizootics generally lead to the extirpation of the affected frog population, and hundreds of such extirpations have occurred in the past two decades as Bd spread across the Sierra Nevada. 

In an effort to increase the probability of frog population persistence through Bd epizootics and boost the chances of future population recovery, numerous chytridiomycosis mitigation efforts have been tested in MYL frog populations during or soon after epizootics. 
Here we report on the effectiveness of three types of treatment to reduce Bd loads and thereby increase frog survival and population persistence: (1) treatment of tadpoles and metamorphs with the antifungal drug itraconazole [garner2009using], (2) treatment of adults with itraconazole, and (3) treatment of metamorphs with *Janthinobacterium lividum*, a bacterium that inhabits amphibian skin and has antifungal properties [@brucker2008amphibian]. 
The motivation for each of these experiments was somewhat different as a result of increases over time in our understanding of responses by the amphibian innate and acquired immune systems to Bd infection. 

The first mitigation experiments were conducted in 2009-2010 and focused on tadpoles and metamorphs. 
These life stages were available in large numbers during a Bd epizootic, in contrast to adults and juveniles that experience high and rapid mortality and disappear early in the epizootic [@vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
In tadpoles, Bd only infects the keratinized portions of tadpole mouthparts and they are little affected. 
However, at metamorphosis the skin rapidly keratinizes and is colonized by Bd [@mcmahon2015transition], and this whole-body infection then results in mortality of metamorphs as well. 
Nonetheless, metamorphs are available for treatment for several weeks before they succumb to chytridiomycosis. 
In addition to these logistical considerations, during this relatively early period in our understanding of frog-Bd dynamics, we relied largely on model results indicating that treatment of a large proportion of a frog population with antifungal drugs could increase individual survival by reducing the density of infective zoospores in the host population or the habitat [@briggs2010enzootic]. 

Early studies on the immune response by frogs against Bd suggested that the acquired immune system of adults was ineffective [@rosenblum2012only; @fites2013invasive]. 
However, more recent discoveries indicate that at least some amphibians, including adult MYL frogs, can develop an acquired immune response that is protective against Bd [@mcmahon2014amphibians; @ellison2014fighting] (Toothman et al., submitted). 
This suggests that antifungal treatments could work in concert with an immune response to increase frog survival during epizootics and facilitate the transition of affected populations to an enzootic state [@briggs2010enzootic]. 
We hypothesized that the high mortality observed in MYL frogs during Bd epizootics is the result of rapid increases in Bd loads on frogs causing severe chytridiomycosis and subsequent mortality before the immune system can fully respond. 
If true, treating adult frogs with antifungal drugs during an epizootic could slow the growth of Bd and allow the full development of acquired immunity, which would increase adult survival and facilitate population persistence in an enzootic state.

Results from recent studies suggest that some symbiotic bacteria inhabiting amphibian skin have antifungal properties [@harris2006amphibian; @woodhams2007symbiotic], and their presence can alter frog-Bd dynamics and increase frog survival in the laboratory [@harris2009skin]. 
In 2012, we tested this possibility in the wild with an experiment in which the skin microbiome of metamorphs was augmented with the bacterium *J. lividum*. 
We assumed that probiotic bacteria might have the strongest effect on Bd-frog dynamics in reducing Bd colonization of relatively lightly infected frogs (and not in reducing Bd load on heavily infected frogs). 
Therefore, prior to exposing frogs to *J. lividum*, we first reduced their Bd loads with seven days of itraconazole treatment. 
For completeness, we also briefly summarize the results of a *J. lividum* augmentation experiment that focused on adult frogs and was led by Vance Vredenburg. 

Finally, we also describe several efforts designed to reestablish frog populations at sites from which they were previously extirpated following Bd epizootics. 
These include reintroduction of adults collected from Bd-naive populations, adults from post-epizootic declining populations, and adults from persistent populations.


# Methods {-}

The following section is divided into general methods that apply to all or most of the experiments, followed by a description of specific methods related to each experiment. 

## General methods {-}

### Visual encounter surveys {-}

Counts of *R. sierrae* life stages (adults: $\geq$ 40 mm SVL; subadults: < 40 mm; tadpoles) were made during diurnal visual encounter surveys (VES) of the entire water body shoreline and the first 100 m of inlet and outlet streams. 
Additional details are provided in [@vredenburg2010dynamics].
Although treatment experiments with early life stages often included metamorphs and not subadults, the distinction between these two stages can be made only by careful inspection and measurement.
Because making this distinction was not possible during visual encounter surveys, hereafter we refer to all post-metamorphic frogs less than 40 mm snout-vent length (SVL), including metamorphs and subadults, as “subadults”. 

### Capture-mark-recapture surveys {-}

To allow estimation of adult survival, we used capture-mark-recapture (CMR) surveys. 
During each summer, the study lakes were re-visited one to three times (i.e., primary periods), and during each primary period all frog populations were generally surveyed on either one day or on three consecutive days. 
During each daily survey, any adult frogs observed were captured, identified (via their tag), and released. 
When captured for the first time during a primary period, frogs were also swabbed, measured, and weighed. 
Any untagged (non-experimental) frogs were tagged and processed as described above.

### Quantifying Bd load using skin swabs {-}

We used skin swabs collected from post-metamorphic animals or swabs collected from tadpole mouthparts, and a real-time quantitative PCR assay to quantify Bd prevalence and infection intensity [@boyle2004rapid; @hyatt2007diagnostic; @vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
For post-metamorphic animals, swabs were stroked across a frog's skin in a standardized way: five strokes on each side of the abdominal midline, five strokes on the inner thighs of each hind leg, and five strokes on the foot webbing of each hind leg (total of 30 strokes per frog). 
For tadpoles, swabs were stroked across the mouthparts 30 times. 
Swabs were air-dried in the field and stored individually in labeled microcentrifuge tubes until analysis. 
We used standard Bd DNA extraction and real-time PCR methods, except that swab extracts were analyzed singly instead of in triplicate [@kriger2006cost]. 
We defined infection intensity as the number of ITS1 copies per swab (see Joseph and Knapp 2018 for details). 
For calculations of Bd prevalence, swabs were categorized as Bd-positive when the number of copies was $\geq$ 0 and as Bd-negative when the number of copies was zero. 
For reference to the figures provided in the Results, in *R. sierrae* adults Bd loads indicative of an epizootic are $\geq$ 600,000 ITS copies (= 5.8 ITS copies on a log10 scale; see Joseph and Knapp 2018 for details).

### Itraconazole treatment {-}

In each of the antifungal treatment experiments, animals (adults, subadults, or tadpoles, depending on the experiment) were captured from the study lakes using hand nets. 
For experiments using adults, immediately following capture a skin swab sample was collected for subsequent measurement of Bd load, and frogs were tagged using 8 mm passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags inserted under the dorsal skin via a small incision, measured, and weighed. 
In experiments using tadpoles or subadults, animals were not tagged. 

Animals in the treated category were held in large mesh pens (2 m * 2 m * 0.75 m) for the duration of the treatment. 
Pens were anchored in the littoral zone of the study lakes, and contained shallow water and shoreline habitats for basking and deeper water habitat (up to 0.7 m) that frogs and tadpoles use at night. 
Control animals were processed in an identical manner, but were held in pens only 3-24 hr and then released back into the lake.

Although it would have been ideal to hold animals from both the treated and control categories in pens for the duration of the treatment (instead of treated animals only), doing so could have produced spurious results. 
Bd transmission is expected to increase with frog density [@rachowicz2007quantifying], and holding untreated control animals in pens (i.e., at high density) could therefore have increased their Bd loads and reduced survival more than would be expected for animals in the treated category that were being given daily antifungal baths. 
This would have biased the outcome toward higher survival of treated compared to control animals even if the antifungal treatment itself had no effect on survival. 
Assuming that holding animals in pens for several days has some negative effect (due to increased Bd transmission even in treated frogs, and lack of feeding opportunities), if our study design caused biases they should be conservative, i.e., reducing the survival of treated animals relative to control animals.

To conduct the antifungal treatments, on each of 5-7 days all animals in the treated category were removed from pens and placed into small plastic tubs that contained a dilute solution (1.5 mg L^‑1^) of the antifungal drug itraconazole (trade name = Sporonox). 
The volume and depth of itraconazole solution varied between 2 and 5 L and allowed all life stages to submerge fully. 
Post-metamorphic animals were treated in batches of approximately 50, and tadpoles in batches of approximately 100. 
After 10 minutes, animals were removed from the tubs and returned to pens. 
To determine treatment effectiveness, all animals or a subset (depending on the experiment) were re-swabbed at the end of the treatment period. 
After the last treatment, all animals were released from the pens into the study lake.

### Statistical analyses {-}

Analyses generally utilized linear and multilevel models analyzed in a Bayesian framework using the *brms* package (@bürkner2017rpackage, @bürkner2018advanced) and R software v. 4.0.3 (@rsoftware2020). 
The primary exception is the analysis of the itraconazole treatment of adults in LeConte Basin that was developed using directly Stan (see "Itraconazole treatment of adults: Leconte Basin" for details). 
When using the *brms* package, our analysis workflow included starting with a linear model that included all relevant population-level ("fixed") effects and their interactions, and checking model fit using visualization of leave-one-out ("LOO") probability integral transforms ("LOO-PIT") (@gelman2013bayesian, @vehtari2017practical). 
When suggested by the data structure, or visualizations of LOO-PIT or conditional ("marginal") effects, we added group-level ("random") effects to the model, or included predictor terms for other parameters of the response distribution (e.g., shape, zero-inflation; see brms vignette, "Estimating distributional models with brms"). 
We compared fits of models with and without the added terms using LOO and the *loo* package (@vehtari2017practical). 
For the sake of brevity, the models described below are the best fit models that resulted from this workflow. 
Predictors of population-level effects and family-specific parameters were considered important when the 95% credible interval (hereafter, "CI") of the estimates did not include zero, and relatively unimportant otherwise. 
Tables of model outputs are provided only for the models that specifically addressed whether treatment had longer-term effects on Bd load and survival. 
Results of analyses to address associated issues (e.g., whether Bd loads were similar before treatment, degree to which Bd loads differed between the beginning and end of the treatment period) are described in the text. 
For all models, we used *brms* defaults for priors, number of chains (4), and warmup and post-warmup iterations (1000 for each). Model convergence was evaluated using trace plots, Gelman-Rubin statistics (Rhat), and measures of effective sample size.  

## Experiment-specific methods {-}

### Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

Bd-caused epizootics and resulting mass die-offs of *R. sierrae* occurred in Barrett Lakes Basin during 2005 to 2007 [@vredenburg2010dynamics] and in Dusy Basin in 2009 (@jani2017epidemic). 
In an effort to prevent the extirpation of remnant populations, itraconazole treatments were conducted over seven consecutive days during mid-summer of 2009 in Barrett and 2010 in Dusy. 
Because adults typically succumb to chytridiomycosis early in an epizootic [@vredenburg2010dynamics], at the time of the experiments these populations contained primarily late-stage tadpoles, recently metamorphosed subadults, and occasionally a small number of residual adults. 
We used results from basin-wide VES conducted prior to the experiments to identify the largest remaining tadpole populations, and these were selected for use in the experiments. 
Populations in both basins were assigned to treated and control groups at random. 
The Barrett experiment included three treated and three control populations, and in Dusy, where fewer frog populations existed, a total of three treated and two control populations were used (Table 1). 
For both experiments, we predicted that itraconazole treatment would reduce Bd loads and increase the survival of animals during metamorphosis. In turn, this would result in more subadults counted during VES conducted in treated versus control populations in the year of and the year following treatment. 

In the Barrett experiment, on July 29 pens were set up in the ponds assigned to the treated group. 
During July 29 to August 1, as many *R. sierrae* as possible (mostly tadpoles) were captured from each pond added to the pens. Swabs were collected from a subset of animals to quantify Bd load.
Daily itaconazole treatments were conducted during the period July 30 -- August 5, and animals were treated from four to seven times, depending on the day of capture. 
To assess treatment effectiveness in reducing Bd loads, swabs were collected from a subset of animals following the final treatment. 
A total of 977 tadpoles and 65 subadults were treated. 
In the control populations, animals were captured on a single day (one population per day during August 2--4), swabbed, held in a pen until capturing was complete, and then released. 
Swabs were collected from a total of 75 tadpoles and 23 subadults. 
To quantify the longer-term effects of treatment on Bd load and frog population dynamics, post-treatment VES were conducted in late August and early September 2009, and in July and August 2010. 

The Dusy experiment was identical in most respects to the Barrett experiment. During July 24--26, we captured as many animals as possible from the ponds assigned to the treated group and placed them in pens. 
Daily itraconazole treatments began on July 27 and lasted through August 2, resulting in seven days of treatment for all animals. 
Swabs were collected from a subset of animals from the ponds assigned to the treated group on July 27 before treatment began, and after the final treatment on August 2. 
A total of 3707 tadpoles and 125 subadults were treated. 
Animals in control populations were captured, swabbed, and released on July 29 (62 tadpoles and 18 subadults). 
Follow-up VES were conducted in mid-August and mid-September 2010, and July and August 2011.

Our analysis of the data from the experiments focused on two questions: During the one-year period following the treatments, did itraconazole treatment influence the (1) Bd loads and (2) survival of treated animals? 
To address the first question, we developed separate models to describe Bd loads of the animals assigned to the treated and control groups before treatment was initiated, the effectiveness of treatment in reducing Bd loads of animals in the treated group, and post-treatment loads in the treated and control groups in the year of treatment and the following year. Because the treatments in Barrett and Dusy basins were virtually identical in their design, we combined the results from both experiments into a single dataset, and to account for any between-treatment differences we included basin as a predictor variable in models.

We evaluated pre-treatment differences in Bd load between treated and control groups (Figure 1: Days = "pre") using the model *bd_load ~ (treatment x basin)* (family = negative binomial, treatment = treated/control, basin = Barrett/Dusy). 
Adding a group-level effect of site_id or using a zero-inflated negative binomial model did not improve model fit. 
Life stage (tadpole, subadult) was not included in the model as a predictor because some ponds had mostly tadpoles and a few had mostly subadults, introducing the potential for singular model fits. 
As such, we relied on the site_id group-level effect to account for between-pond variation resulting from the predominance of one life stage or another. The group-level effect of site_id on model fit was negligible, indicating that the inability to account for the potential effects of different life stages likely did not bias the model outcome. 

The immediate effect of treatment on Bd load was assessed using the model *bd_load ~ stage + treat_category x basin* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, treat_category = beginning/end of treatment period). 
We were able to include stage in this model because many tadpoles metamorphosed into subadults during the treatment, producing a more balanced representation of stages across sites. 
Plots of conditional effects suggested substantial differences in Bd load variation between the beginning and end of the treatment period, between stages, and between basins. Differences in zero inflation were also evident for treatment_category and stage. 
Therefore, the shape parameter was also modeled as a function of stage, treat_category, and basin , and the zero-inflation parameter was modeled as a function of treat_category and stage (additive effects only). 

The effect of treatment on Bd loads over the remainder of the summer during which treatment occurred and during the following summer was evaluated using the model *bd_load ~ stage + basin + (treatment x year) + (1 | site_id)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, year is a dummy variable in which 0 = year of treatment and 1 = year after treatment, site_id included as a group-level effect). 
Plots of conditional effects suggested substantial differences in Bd load variation between the treated and control groups, and between stages and between years. 
In addition, the degree of zero inflation suggested differences between treated and control groups, and between basins.   
As such, the shape and zero-inflation parameters were also modeled as a function of treatment, stage, basin, and year (additive effects only). 

The effect of treatment on subadult survival was assessed using the model *count ~ basin + tadpole + (std_year x treatment) + (1|site_id)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, subadult = number of subadults counted during a VES, tadpole = number of tadpoles counted during the same VES - log10 transformed). The count of subadults served as a proxy for subadult survival, which could not be estimated directly. To account for differences between ponds in potential subadult production due to difference in the number of tadpoles (= future subadults), we included the tadpole count variable. No need for shape or zi predictors was evident. 

















The two swabbing time periods used in the multi-factor ANOVA included “pre-treatment” and “post-treatment”. 
The pre-treatment period included swabs collected from animals in the treated populations before they were exposed to itraconazole, and swabs from control populations collected in the middle of the treatment period. 
The “post-treatment” period included swabs collected from all populations approximately two weeks after the conclusion of the treatment period (day 21-24). 
Although swabs were collected from treated animals on the last day of itraconazole treatment (day 7), due to logistical challenges related to the amount of time required to capture and swab large numbers of animals, we were unable to collect a corresponding set of swabs from control populations at that time. 
Therefore, we defined the “post-treatment” period as swabs collected two weeks after the conclusion of the treatment period when swabs were available from both control and treated populations. 

Model selection and validation procedures followed [@zuur2009mixed] (Section 4.2.3 and Appendix A).
As part of the model selection process, we investigated using linear mixed effects models, but found the simpler ANOVA design provided greater explanatory power as measured by ANOVA and AIC. 
The pair variable was tested for inclusion as a random effect, but it did not improve model fit and was removed during the variable selection procedure. 
Basin and site id were closely related to the pair variable, so were not included as separate predictor variables in the model. 

We conducted three additional analyses focused on the first research question. 
First, because the multi-factor ANOVA didn’t allow a direct assessment of the change in Bd loads over the treatment period, we used a one-way ANOVA applied to data from treated animals only to compare pre-treatment Bd loads with loads measured on the last day of treatment (day 7). 
For this analysis, Bd load data were pooled across basins. 
Second, we evaluated Bd prevalence with a binomial test in both treated and control populations two weeks prior to the experiment to determine how infected these populations were prior to treatment.
Finally, we used Fisher’s exact test to see whether Bd load (should this be prevalence?) was different between treated and control animals in the pre-treatment period versus the post-treatment period, 2 weeks after the experiment. 
Fisher’s exact test was used instead of a Chi-square test because of small sample sizes in some cells of the contingency table.

To address the second question regarding the long-term effects of treatment on frog survival, we were limited to using VES data. 
Ideally, we would have repeatedly sampled the treated and control cohorts over time and described survival directly using CMR methods. 
This wasn’t possible due to the inability to mark individuals and to the time required to repeatedly recapture hundreds of animals. 
Therefore, we used count data from VES to determine whether treated populations had more subadult frogs than did control populations, a pattern that would be consistent with higher survival of treated animals. 
We used raw count data, but the observed patterns were unchanged when animal density (count per meter of shoreline) was used instead. 

*Effect of treatment on zoospore pool*. During the itraconazole treatments in Dusy Basin in 2010, we tested if treatment of frogs reduced the concentration of planktonic Bd cells (“zoospore pool”) in pond water. 
We sampled the zoospore pool before and after itraconazole treatments (July 23-25 and August 21-24, respectively), in each of the five ponds included in the experiment (Table S1). 
[ref previous studies measuring zoospore pools?] 
Water samples (six per pond) were collected by filtering water through a 0.22 mm pore polyethersulfone filter (Sterivex-GP; Millipore), until the filter clogged. 
Filters were immediately amended with sucrose lysis buffer (40 mmol/l 1 EDTA, 50 mmol/l 1 Tris-HCl, 750 mmol/l sucrose, pH adjusted to 8.0). 
DNA was extracted using the DNEasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). 
DNA extracts were diluted 1:50 for qPCR. 
Quantitative PCR conditions and standards were as in [@jani2017epidemic], with a six-point standard curve. 
For each sample, we ran three technical replicates, each from an independent sample dilution and on an independent PCR run. 
Bd load data were transformed as log10(Bd load + 1), where 1 was added to avoid negative values that result from log10 transformation of numbers less than 1. 
Methods used to validate the measurement of zoospore pools are provided in Supplementary Materials. 

We were interested in whether itraconazole treatment affected the temporal change in Bd zoospore pools, i.e., whether itraconazole-treated ponds showed smaller increases in zoospore pools over time compared with control ponds. 
We therefore analyzed the Bd loads (ITS copies) and Bd status (Bd-positive or Bd-negative) of water samples separately to avoid confounding state changes with quantitative changes. 
To test if itraconazole treatment affected Bd loads, we restricted the data to Bd-positive samples and used a mixed effects model with treatment, time period (before or after treatment), and their interaction as fixed effects and pond as a random effect. 
To analyze changes in Bd-state, we converted the data to the number of Bd-positive samples in each lake, with sampling effort per lake being equal at n = 6 per lake). 
This reduced the data to 10 points: one per lake for each sampling phase. 
We then tested if the number of positive filters per lake was affected by treatment, again using a linear mixed model with treatment, time period, and their interaction fixed and pond random. 
We note that the analysis of Bd-state is not precise because failure to detect Bd in a sample indicates only that the sample falls below the limit of detection, not necessarily that the sample is truly Bd-negative.

### Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

*LeConte Basin*. In mid-summer 2015, routine disease surveillance in Kings Canyon National Park at one of the largest remaining Bd-naïve *R. sierrae* populations detected high Bd loads (Figure S1) and the presence of many moribund and dead frogs. 
In response to this epizootic, we immediately conducted two antifungal treatment experiments, one in the lower portion of the basin and one in the upper portion (Table S1). 
The lower basin contains two lakes and four smaller ponds, and the upper basin contains a single lake. 
At the time of the experiments, all of these water bodies were occupied by *R. sierrae*. The two basins are approximately 750 m apart and are linked by streams and relatively gentle terrain; we therefore expected some movement of frogs between them.

The design of the treatment experiments in the lower and upper basins was nearly identical, differing only in the number of days spent capturing frogs for the “treated” category (three versus two days, respectively; Table S3). 
To simplify logistics, frogs in the treated category were captured during the first 2-3 days of the experiment, and frogs for the untreated (“control”) category were captured on the following day (day 3 or 4). 
All frogs included in the study were adults, and were collected opportunistically using hand-held nets. 
Frogs that were visibly sick (as indicated by an impaired righting reflex) were excluded because these frogs were likely within hours of death. 
In the lower basin, a total of 360 and 102 frogs were captured for the treated and control categories, respectively. 
In the upper basin, these totals were 206 and 74 frogs. 
To meet our goal of completing frog capture and processing as quickly as possible (to minimize the introduction of additional confounding effects into the experiments), the number of adult frogs included in each experiment likely represented a relatively small proportion of those present. 

For each frog in the treated category, immediately following capture a skin swab sample was collected for subsequent measurement of Bd load (see General Methods). 
Following swabbing, frogs were tagged, measured, weighed, and released into pens. 
Control frogs were captured, processed, and released (see General Methods).

Itraconazole treatments were conducted as described in General Methods and Table S3. 
To determine treatment effectiveness, 93 frogs in the lower basin treated group (31 from each capture date) and 50 frogs in the upper basin treated group (25 from each capture date) were re-swabbed on the day prior to the last treatment. 
After the last treatment, all frogs were released from the pens into the lake (nlower = 286, nupper = 127).

The outcome of the treatment experiments was quantified using CMR surveys conducted during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018, as described in the General Methods. 
No post-treatment surveys were possible in 2015 because the frog active season was nearly over by the time the treatments were completed. 
There were 1-3 primary periods per summer, and except the final period in 2018 when only a one-day survey was conducted, all frog populations were surveyed on each of three consecutive days. 
Any untagged frogs captured during the surveys (i.e., frogs that were not part of the initial treatment phase of the experiment; “non-experimental”) were tagged and processed as described above.

We used open population multi-state hidden Markov models to understand subsequent population dynamics including survival, recruitment, Bd loads, and detection. 
We used parameter-expanded Bayesian data augmentation, which augments the capture histories of observed individuals with a large number of capture histories for individuals that were never detected [@royle2012parameter].
The states included (1) “not recruited”, (2) “alive at the upper site”, (3) “alive at the lower site”, and (4) “dead”. 
On any particular survey, we considered three possible observations of an individual: (1) “alive at the upper site”, (2) “alive at the lower site”, and (3) “not detected”. 
The model structure builds on the work of Joseph and Knapp (2018), tracking individual Bd (log) loads over time, allowing the expected loge(Bd load + 1) to vary as a function of treatment and time, and allowing the effect of Bd load on survival and detection to vary as a function of treatment.

*Treasure Lakes Basin*. In July 2018, we conducted an antifungal treatment of adult *R. sierrae* during a Bd epizootic in the Treasure Lakes basin, Inyo National Forest (Table S1). 
Epizootics occurred in all other populations in the basin during summer 2017, and during the 2018 treatment the epizootic was occurring in the lake containing last known adult frogs in the basin.
This treatment was conducted as a management action - rather than an experiment - primarily due to the advanced stage of the epizootic and the small number of adults remaining in the basin. 
In the VES conducted just prior to the treatment period we found only 12 adult *R. sierrae*, and captured only 28 frogs during the first day of frog collection (12 person-hours). 
Dividing this small population into treated and untreated control groups would have provided little statistical power to detect between-group differences given low anticipated post-treatment recapture rates. 
In addition, fewer frogs would have received antifungal treatment. 
The lack of an experimental design limits the generality of our findings, but the treatment is nonetheless included here because of the additional insights the results provide. 

On July 16, we began the itraconazole treatment with 28 adult frogs. 
We used the same methods as described for the LeConte treatments, with two important differences: 1) all frogs were treated (there was no untreated control group), and 2) new frogs were captured from the lake and added to the pens during the first five days of the 7-day treatment period. 
We treated 28 frogs on July 16, then added and treated an additional 24, 7, 7, 4, and 4 frogs on July 17 through 21, respectively. 
Although we captured and treated a total of 74 frogs, we released only 33 live frogs at the end of the treatment due to chytridiomycosis-caused mortality throughout the treatment period (Figure A).
Treatment effectiveness was assessed by re-swabbing each surviving frog after the final itraconazole treatment. 
We conducted follow-up VES, swabbing, and CMR surveys one month after the treatment (August 21-23) and again one year later (August 15-16, 2019).  

To evaluate the effect of itraconazole treatment on Bd loads, we calculated the between sample difference in Bd loads on individual frogs as the negative log ratio of pre-treatment Bd loads to post-treatment Bd loads: -log10((load~pre~ + 1)/(load~post~ + 1). 
A negative ratio indicates a reduction in Bd load, and a larger absolute value indicates a larger reduction. 
In the analysis of the itraconazole treatment, we used a multiple linear regression model with the negative log ratio as the response variable and the initial load (standardized to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1) and number of antifungal treatments provided to each individual as independent predictor variables. 
We performed model validation and selection as described in [@zuur2009mixed].

### Microbiome augmentation of subadult frogs {-}

In 2012, the Bd epizootic in Dusy Basin (see "Itraconazole treatment of early life stages" section) was ongoing and most *R. sierrae* populations were extirpated. 
Those populations that remained contained only late-stage tadpoles and recently metamorphosed subadults, and given the absence of any adults were presumed to be the final cohorts at these sites. 
In July 2012, we initiated an experiment to test the combined effect of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* augmentation on Bd load and frog survival. 
For this experiment, we selected a single pond where late-stage tadpoles and recently-metamorphosed subadults were still relatively abundant. 
This pond was used previously in the 2010 experiment in which early life stages were treated with itraconazole (Table S1). 

The experimental design focused solely on subadults, and included a treatment group (itraconazole treatment followed by *J. lividum* exposure) and a control group (no itraconazole, no *J. lividum*)). 
We did not test independent or interactive effects of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* augmentation, a decision prompted by our previous experiments with early life stages showing a the lack of longer-term benefits of itraconazole treatment (see Results) and the limited number of subadults available at the study pond. 
Animals were captured on July 12-13 (331 subadults) and assigned to treated and control groups at a ratio of approximately 80:20 (271 treated, 60 control). 
This ratio was chosen to maximize the number of subadults receiving antifungal treatment, and therefore the potential benefit to the population. 
All animals were given group-specific toe-clips as follows: (i) control = toe 2 on left front foot, and (ii) treated with itraconazole and *J. lividum* = toe 2 on right front foot. 
We used toe clips because other tagging methods (e.g., visual implant elastomer, VI Alpha tags: Northwest Marine Technology) were not sufficiently visible through the dark skin of subadults. 
Following processing, subadults were animals were held in large (2 m x 2 m) mesh pens by group (i.e., treated and control). 
To determine Bd loads prior to the start of the treatment period, a subset of subadults from both groups were swabbed on July 12 and 13, and all control animals were released back into the study pond on July 13. 
Itraconazole treatments were conducted daily on July 12-18, and the number of animals in each group declined somewhat during this period due to Bd-caused mortality and occasional predation by gartersnakes. 
To assess the effectiveness of itraconazole treatment in reducing Bd loads over the 7-day treatment period and to quantify the amount of *J. lividum* present naturally on subadults in this population, we swabbed a subset of animals on July 19 immediately prior to *J. lividum* exposure. 

*J. lividum* for use in the experiment was obtained from the skin of an adult *R. sierrae* in Dusy Basin in 2009 and cultured using standard methods [@harris2009skin]. 
On July 19-20, we bathed the itraconazole-treated subadults (n = 256) in a solution of water from the study pond (2 L) and *J. lividum* culture for 4-4.5 hours (75 and 150 mL of *J. lividum* culture per liter of lake water on July 19 and 20, respectively). 
At the conclusion of the second *J. lividum* bath, all treated animals were released into the pond.

To assess the effect of the combined itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment, we surveyed the study population during the summers of 2012 (n = 3 surveys), 2013 (n = 4), and 2014 (n = 1). 
During each of these surveys, we conducted VES and captured and swabbed as many subadult and adult frogs as possible, and recorded the toe-clip status for each individual. 

The questions that analyses of collected data focused on were similar to those described in the methods for the section "Itraconazole treatment of early life stages". 
Specifically, we asked whether animals exposed to the combined itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment had (1) higher concentrations of *J. lividum* and lower Bd loads than untreated control animals and non-experimental ("wild") animals during the two summer months following the end of the treatment period, and (2) higher survival than control animals. 
For question 2, we assumed that the percentage of animals in each groupt that were recaptured was an accurate proxy of survival. 
Unlike the Barrett-Dusy dataset that had hierarchical structures, this dataset did not; therefore, we used linear instead of multilevel models.
Unfortunately, recaptures of control animals quickly declined to near zero, thereby precluding formal comparisons of *J. lividum* and Bd load on treated versus control animals.
We were able to compare treated versus wild frogs, but importantly, unlike the treated and control groups that each contained a single cohort of tagged animals that was repeatedly sampled over time, membership of animals in the wild group likely changed over time as new individuals entered the group and others were removed (e.g., via mortality). 

To describe *J.lividum* concentrations and Bd loads on treated versus wild frogs, we used a negative binomial model (response variable = *J. lividum*) or a zero-inflated negative binomial model (response variable = Bd load). 
Both models included the number of days since *J.lividum* exposure, group (treated, wild), and the days*group interaction as predictor variables.
A predictor variable describing frog life stage (i.e., subadult, adult) was not included because subadults were the only stage that was recaptured during the experiment. 
In addition, we compared Bd loads on subadults assigned to the treated and control groups prior to itraconazole treatment using a negative binomial model with group as the only predictor. 
Finally, the effectiveness of itraconazole treatment was assessed by comparing Bd loads on subadults in the treated group at the beginning and end of the treatment period (zero-inflated negative binomial model). 

As with the *J. lividum* analyses, formal assessment of the effect of treatment on survival was not possible due to the rapid disappearance of animals in the control group. Therefore, we provide a verbal description of the percent of treated and control animals that were recaptured during each site visit in 2012 (n = 3) , 2013 (n = 3), 2014 (n = 1), and 2019 (n = 1). 

### Reintroduction of adults from Bd-naive populations {-}

Recent evidence indicates that Bd infection of MYL frogs prompts an immune response that reduces susceptibility of exposed individuals to future infection (Toothman et al., in preparation). 
To test whether infecting frogs with Bd and then clearing them of infection would increase the survival of frogs reintroduced into Bd-positive habitats, we planned an experiment in which Bd-exposed and unexposed (control) frogs were each reintroduced into three lakes.
Although the Bd exposures did not produce the expected high-level infections, as described below, we include the study in this report to provide a description of the experiment and the consequences of reintroducing frogs that were essentially Bd-naive into Bd-positive sites.

In July 2013, we collected 100 adult *R. muscosa* from a large Bd-naive population ("Spur Basin") located in the headwaters of Bubbs Creek, South Fork Kings River, Kings Canyon National Park. Captured frogs were PIT tagged, swabbed, measured, and weighed, and held overnight in large mesh pens. 
The following day, frogs were transported out the backcountry via helicopter, and then driven to the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory. 
In subsequent days, frogs were randomly assigned to Bd-exposed and unexposed control treatments, housed individually in small aquaria, and fed crickets several times per week. 
To initiate the experiment, a standard number of Bd zoospores was added to each tank assigned to the exposed treatment (July 7). 
After the first exposure and continuing until all frogs were cleared of infection, exposed and control frogs were swabbed weekly to quantify Bd loads. 
This infection protocol has been used successfully to infect MYL frogs with Bd during multiple experiments, and following exposure frogs typically develop high loads within four weeks.
In this experiment, all frogs became infected (based on week 1 swabs), but after four weeks none had developed moderate or high loads.  
We therefore opted to conduct another round of exposures. Bd infections were first cleared with itraconazole [@jones2012treatment], and the subsequent Bd exposure was conducted as previously (July 30). 
Re-exposure again produced only low-level Bd infections, as did a third exposure conducted on August 17. 
Due to logistical considerations associated with holding frogs overwinter, we opted to release frogs back into the wild. 
We did not expect that the observed low-level Bd infections were sufficient to cause the development of an immune response, but the reintroductions nonetheless allowed us to test the assumption that Bd-naive frogs introduced into Bd-positive habitats would rapidly become infected with Bd and succumb to chytridiomycosis.  
Frogs were cleared of infection as referenced previously, and in early September were transported to the three reintroduction lakes.
Frogs were helicoptered to the Bench Lake Ranger Station, and transported from there to each lake on foot. 
The sites were located in three different lake basins (Ruskin, Upper, and Pinchot), separated by 3--7 km. 
All three sites were occupied historically by large *R. muscosa* populations that were extirpated during the previous decade following Bd epizootics. 

To describe the dynamics of the reintroduced populations, we used standard CMR methods [@joseph2018disease]. Sites were visited 1-3 times during the summers  (June–September) of 2014--2019, and on a single day per visit (primary period) all habitats were searched repeatedly for frogs. 
Frogs were captured using handheld nets, identified via their PIT tag (or tagged if they were untagged), measured, weighed, swabbed, and released at the capture location. 
Survival of translocated frogs, frog population size, and recruitment of new adults was estimated using R software [@rsoftware2020] and the mrmr package developed by M. Joseph (https://snarl1.github.io/mrmr/). 

### Reintroduction of adults from declining populations {-}

The ongoing spread of Bd across Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks has resulted in the decline of hundreds of mountain yellow-legged frog populations to extirpation or near-extirpation.
In an effort to increase the likelihood that remnant populations would persist, in collaboration with SEKI staff we conducted four frog reintroduction studies during the period 2015-2019. 
Details are provided in a report submitted to SEKI in 2020 ("Critical Restoration Efforts Needed to Recover Endangered Mountain Yellow-legged Frogs in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks - Final Report") and are summarized here and in the Results.
Early stage animals (tadpoles and subadults) were collected from four populations (Tyndall, Milestone, Sixty Lake, Pinchot) that had recently experienced Bd epizootics and declined to near-extirpation, and delivered them to the San Francisco and Oakland Zoos for rearing to adulthood. 
In preparation for reintroduction into the basin from which they were originally collected, at least half of the frogs from each population were exposed to Bd and the remaining frogs served as unexposed controls.
In contrast to the Bd-exposure of the Spur Basin frogs (described in *Reintroduction of adults from declining populations*, above), following Bd exposure frogs from all four populations developed moderate-to-high infection loads and were subsequently cleared of infection using itraconazole. 
To avoid introducing confounding effects into the experiment, frogs in the control group were also treated with itraconazole using the same methods.
Following release back into the study basins, populations were assessed using standard VES and CMR surveys to determine Bd loads and frog survival, population size, and recruitment. 

### Reintroduction of adults from persistent populations {-}

Recent evidence indicates that MYL frog populations that declined following Bd epizootics and in which frogs persisted in low numbers for 1--2 decades have begun to recover [@knapp2016large].
These recovering (enzootic) populations would seem ideal sources of frogs for direct translocation to sites from which frogs were recently extirpated. 
However, the use of translocations in SEKI is limited by the small number of enzootic populations that have developed to date. 
Recovering populations are much more common in Yosemite National Park, and have been used as sources of frogs for multiple translocations conducted there since 2006. 
The details of these translocations are available in a report submitted to YOSE in 2020 ("Describing the dynamics of translocated Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog populations in Yosemite National Park to aid future conservation efforts"), and are summarized in the Results

## Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

Immediately before itraconazole treatments in the Barrett and Dusy experiments began, Bd loads of animals in ponds assigned to the treated and control groups were similar (Figure 1: Days = "pre"). 
Model results indicated that treatment group did not affect Bd load (CI: -1.36 -- 1.69), nor did the treatment x basin interaction term (CI: -0.52 -- 3.19). Basin had a weak effect, and Bd loads in Dusy were slightly lower than in Barrett (CI: -2.86 -- -0.02). 

The  treatments substantially reduced Bd loads of treated populations (Figure 1: Days = "pre" versus "7"). 
Model results indicated an important effect of treatment category (lower at end than beginning; CI: -3.04 -- -2.18). 
In addition, important effects on Bd load were also evident for stage (lower in tadpoles than subadults; CI: -2.65 -- -1.68), basin (higher in Dusy than Barrett; CI: 1.35 -- 2.04), and the (basin x treatment_category) interaction term (loads were higher in Dusy than Barrett at the beginning of the treatment, but lower in Dusy than Barrett at the end of treatment; Figure 1). 
Finally, treatment category, stage, and basin all had important effects on the shape parameter, as did treatment category and stage on the zero-inflation parameter. 

The reduction in Bd load in treated versus control groups that was evident at the end of the treatment period persisted into subsequent months (Figure 1: Days > 7). 
Model results (Table 1) showed important effects on Bd load of most predictor variables, including treatment (treated lower than control), stage (lower in tadpoles than subadults), year (lower in year 1 than year 0), and the (year x treatment_category) interaction term. 
Basin did not have an important effect. 
The (year x treatment_category) term indicated that Bd loads were lower in the treated group than the control group in year 0, but that loads in the treated and control groups were similar in year 1. 
Therefore, although the treatment effect was evident for more than a month, Bd loads on animals in treated ponds returned to pre-treatment levels in the year following treatment (Figure 1). 
All predictors of family-specific parameters had important effects and their inclusion, especially those of the shape parameter, substantially improved model fit. 

The reduction in Bd load caused by the treatment was associated with increased counts of subadults in treated versus control populations (Figure 2). 
Model results supported the importance of treatment, with treatment and the (year x treatment) interaction term having important effects (Table 4). 
The effects of tadpole count, basin, and year were unimportant. 
The interaction term indicated that treated populations had higher subadult counts than control populations in the year of the treatment, but that counts in treated populations in the year following treatment were low and similar to that in control populations (Figure 2). 
Therefore, mirroring the longer-term effects of treatment on Bd load, the increase in subadult survival in treated populations in the month following treatment was no longer evident in the year following treatment. 












Two weeks prior to the itraconazole treatments, loads were high in all populations, and similar between populations assigned to the treated and control categories (one-way ANOVA: F1,81 = 1.97, p = 0.17). 
Bd prevalence was near 100% at all sites (Barrett: 100%, CI = 86-100%, n = 24; Dusy: 98%, CI = 90-99%, n = 54). 
At the end of the treatment period, Bd loads of treated animals were significantly lower than during the pre-treatment period (one-way ANOVA, F1,540 = 646.3, p < 0.0001). 
In contrast, prevalence was unchanged by treatment (two-sided Fisher’s exact text, p = 1.00), indicating that treatment reduced loads but did not clear animals of infection. 

The final multi-factor ANOVA model included life stage, treatment, time period, and the interaction between treatment and period (adjusted r2 = 0.40, DF = 778, F = 130; Table 1). 
Between the pre and post periods, Bd loads of treated populations decreased by a similar amount in both basins (Barrett: average load decreased from 61,000 to 1,200 copies; Dusy: average load decreased from 73,000 to 6,100 copies). 
However, these reductions were short-lived, with no differences in Bd loads between treated and control populations observed in subsequent surveys (Figure 1). 

Comparison of frog counts between treated and control populations suggested that treatment had short-term positive effects on frog survival. 
In both the Barrett and Dusy experiments, despite differences between populations in the number of tadpoles counted prior to the treatment (Table S2), one month after the treatment period the number of subadults in all five treated populations showed a short-term increase but only one of five control populations showed a corresponding increase (Figure 2). 
However, this pulse of subadults never appeared as a new cohort of adults, and all treated and control populations in both basins declined to extirpation within 3-5 years (Figure 2).

*Effect of treatment on zoospore pool*. Temporal change in aquatic zoospore pools in Dusy Basin were affected by itraconazole treatment (time * treatment interaction: p = 0.048), apparently because zoospore pools increased marginally in control lakes but not treatment lakes (contrasts comparing before-treatment to after-treatment, p = 0.055 and 0.391 for control and treatment groups, respectively, Figure [AJ1]). 
Treatment also marginally affected the number of samples that were Bd-positive per lake (time * treatment interaction: p = 0.066), with a greater increase in positive samples in treatment lakes relative to controls (Figure [AJ2]).

## Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

### LeConte Basin {-}

Visual surveys of *R. sierrae* populations conducted in the lower and upper basins of the study area between 2005 and 2014 indicated average minimum population sizes of approximately 2,800 and 500 adults, respectively. 
During this same time period, qPCR-based Bd surveillance indicated that Bd prevalence and load were generally zero or near-zero (Figure S1). 
Prevalence and load increased in 2012 but declined to baseline levels in 2013 and 2014. 
(We have observed similar “failed Bd invasions” in other Bd-naïve MYL frog populations in SEKI.) 
Until 2015, Bd loads on individual frogs were always far below levels indicative of a Bd epizootic (Figure S1), and no mass mortality events were observed during visual surveys or sample collection.
However, in mid-summer 2015 we detected a rapid increase in Bd prevalence and load (Figure S1) in the lower basin, and VES produced a count of 196 dead adults (and 772 live adults). 
Collectively, these results indicated that an epizootic was underway. 
Concurrent sampling in the upper basin indicated that Bd prevalence and load remained low in that population, and only one dead adult (and 791 live adults) was detected during VES. 
A treatment experiment was initiated in the lower basin 10 days after the epizootic was detected (the 10-day lag was due to logistical constraints). 
Subsequent Bd surveillance indicated that by the time the lower basin treatment was nearing completion in late-August, an epizootic was beginning in the upper basin (Fig. S1). This provided an opportunity to conduct a second treatment experiment.

In 2015, prior to the treatment period, frogs in the treated and control groups had very high Bd loads, and those of frogs in the control group were somewhat higher than those in the treated group (Figure 2, Table SX). 
However, Bd loads of both groups were above the level at which symptoms of severe chytridiomycosis are evident. Samples collected at the end of the 7-9 day treatment period indicated that the treatment was effective in reducing Bd loads on treated frogs by 1.4-2.7 orders of magnitude (Figure 2, Table SX). 
During the treatment period, 74 of the lower basin treated frogs and 79 of the upper basin treated frogs died. 
Of the frogs that died, most did so during the first half of the treatment period (lower basin: 73%; upper basin: 74%), consistent with frogs succumbing to chytridiomycosis. 
However, Bd loads were not higher on frogs that died versus survived (Table SX). 
All control frogs survived during the several hour period between capture, processing, and release.

During the three year post-treatment period and across both basins, 51% of treated frogs and 2% of control frogs were recaptured. 
In CMR surveys conducted during 2016-2018, a total of 2212 adult frogs were captured, representing 835 unique individuals. 
During the four year period between the 2015 itraconazole treatment and the final survey in 2018, three captured individuals were known to have moved from the upper basin to the lower basin. 
All three individuals were in the “treated” group. 
Of the 749 unique frogs captured in the lower basin, 132 were in the “treated” group, two were in the “control” group, and 615 were not part of the original treatment experiment (“non-experimental”). 
These non-experimental frogs could have either survived the 2015 Bd epizootic as adults or recruited into the adult population after the epizootic. 
In the upper basin, of the 89 unique frogs captured, 81 were treated in 2015 and eight were non-experimental. 
No control frogs were captured. 
Across the entire duration of the experiment, the 1,212 individuals that were observed were estimated to represent approximately 83% (posterior median) of the adults that existed in the LeConte population from 2015 to 2018 (95% credible interval: 71%, 92%).

Bd loads on control animals were substantially higher than treated and non-experimental animals subsequent to the 2015 field treatments (posterior probability = 1). 
<<TODO: after re-running the models with updated data - include the 95%CIs for Bd load in the treated and control group immediately after the treatment in 2015, and in the first primary period of 2016)>> 
The two control animals that were recaptured in the year after the field treatments both had relatively low loads relative to the rest of the individuals in the control group (Fig. 5A). 
Overall, the LeConte adult population declined in abundance from 2015 to 2018, with the most rapid declines in the control group (Fig. 5B). 
Between the end of the treatments in 2015 and the first surveys of 2016, the number of animals surviving in the control group dropped from 176 to 12 (95% CI: 2, 43). 
By the end of the summer in 2016, the posterior median for the number of surviving control animals was zero (95% CI: 0, 6). 
Bd had a stronger negative effect in the control group relative to the treated and non-experimental animals (posterior probabilities = 0.93, and 0.91, respectively; Fig. 5C). 
In the last primary period of 2018, the posterior median for the number of treated frogs alive was 4 (95% credible interval: 0, 13), 48 for non-experimental frogs (95% credible interval: 18, 93), and zero for controls (95% CI: 0, 0). 

### Treasure Lakes Basin {-}

During the Bd epizootic and prior to the itraconzole treatment, Bd prevalence in this population was 98% (n = 52, 95% CI = 90-100%). 
At the conclusion of the treatment, prevalence was similar to pre-treatment levels (94%: n = 33, 95% CI: 80-99%; Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.33), but one month after treatment prevalence had declined substantially to 29% (n = 17, 95% CI: 10-56%). 

In contrast to prevalence, itraconazole treatment significantly reduced mean Bd loads, and loads remained low a month after treatment (Table ?; n = 124, ANOVA, F~2,121~ = 8.9, p = 0.0003). 
Relative to the mean pretreatment load, the mean post-treatment load was 3.8 * 10^6^ copies lower (p = 0.004), and the mean follow-up load was 5.0 * 10^6^ copies lower (p = 0.003); the latter samples did not differ from each other (difference = 1.2 * 10^6^, p = 0.75). 
The mean log ratio of pre-treatment:post-treatment Bd loads on individual frogs was -5.4 (SD = 4.1, n = 32). 
Therefore mean load pre-treatment was 5.4 fold (or 440%) higher than it was post-treatment. 
In the best-fit linear regression model (R^2^~adj~ = 0.5, F~2,29~ = 14, p < 0.0001, Figure ?) of factors affecting Bd load change (expressed as the log ratio), the predictor variables were initial Bd load (coefficient = -2.3, SE = 0.54, t~29~ = -4.3, p << 0.001) and number of days of antifungal treatment (coefficient = -1.3, SE = 0.4, t~29~ = -3.6, p = 0.001). , …

<< Add paragraph >>

Of the 33 frogs that were released back into the lake following treatment, 16 were recaptured in the survey conducted one month later (one non-experimental frog was also captured). 
However, in surveys conducted in 2019, we observed no *R. sierrae* of any life stage. 
Therefore, despite the substantial reduction in Bd loads caused by the 2018 treatment and the relatively large fraction of frogs recaptured one month later, few or none of the frogs survived overwinter until summer 2019. 


## Microbiome augmentation of subadult frogs {-}

In the Dusy Basin microbiome augmentation experiment, prior to the itraconazole treatment Bd loads were similar in control and treated subadults (CI -0.37 -- 0.71; Figure x1).
The 7-day itraconazole treatment reduced Bd loads more than 4 orders of magnitude subadults (CI  -9.34 -- -8.50; Figure x1). 

*J. lividum* exposure started on the day following the last day of itraconazole treatment, and on that day *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults assigned to the treated group were either zero or near-zero in all individuals (day 0; Figure x2). 
Twelve days after the two *J. lividum* baths to which animals in the treated group were subjected, *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults were high, but unexpectedly the concentrations were similarly high in treated, control, and wild groups instead of only in the treated group (day 0 versus 12; Figure x2).
This indicates that *J. lividum* exposure of animals in the treated group resulted in the effective transfer of *J. lividum* to other frogs in the pond that had not been treated with itraconazole. 
However, over the following three months, *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults declined rapidly to near baseline levels (Figure x2). 
Formal comparison of *J lividum* concentrations from day 12 to day 56 across all three groups wasn't possible due to the almost complete loss of control frogs by day 37 (n = 1) and day 56 (n = 0). 
However, a model that included the treated and wild groups indicated an important effect on *J. lividum* concentration of days since *J. lividum* exposure, but no effect of group or a (day * group) interaction term. 
Therefore, *J. lividum* concentrations declined over the 3-month period and at similar rates in both treated and wild frogs (Table x1). 

Following release of frogs in the treated group (itraconazole-treated and *J. lividum*-exposed) back into the study pond, their Bd loads increased steadily and reached pre-treatment levels after three months (day 56). 
Due to the rapid loss of frogs in the control group, formal comparison of Bd loads from day 12 to day 56 across all three groups wasn't possible. 
However, a model that included the treated and wild groups indicated that Bd loads increased from day 12 to day 56, and that Bd loads of wild frogs were higher than those of treated frogs. 
In addition, there was an important effect of the (days * group) interaction, due to increased in loads of treated frogs and relatively constant loads of wild frogs (Table X). 
Together, these results indicated that the combined effect of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* exposure was ineffective in preventing the increase in Bd loads to pre-treatment levels. 
Increased concentrations of *J. lividum* on control and wild frogs also had no obvious effect on Bd load. 

During the three surveys of the study pond conducted in 2012, the percent of frogs in the treated and control groups that were recaptured declined, but the rate of decline was steeper in the control versus treated group (Figure x3). 
Although no formal analysis is possible due to the relatively few sample points, the results suggest that the intraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment increased frog survival over three month period following the treatment. 
Only a single experimental animal was captured during surveys in subsequent years, and no *R. sierrae* of any life stage was detected during surveys in 2014 and 2019. 
The one experimental (i.e., toe-clipped) animal captured after 2012 was detected during a survey on 26-June, and was a member of the treated group. 
In conclusion, the itraconazole-*J. lividum* exposure did not increase survival sufficiently to allow persistence of this population over the longer-term. 


## Reintroduction of adults from Bd-naive populations {-}

Bd-naive adult *R. muscosa* reintroduced to Ruskin, Upper, and Pinchot basins all became Bd-positive within 1-X years, and declined to extirpation or near-extirpation. 
In Ruskin Basin, frogs were introduced to site ID 10285 and subsequently stayed mostly at that site. 
A single reintroduced adult was captured in 10284 in 2014, but no frogs were ever detected at 10286 downstream. 
By the time of the first post-reintroduction visit to this site in July 2014 (no visit was made to this site in 2013), frogs had become infected with Bd (prevalence = 56%), but loads were very low (range = 0-1344 ITS copies). 
However, by the August and September 2014 visits, Bd prevalence was 100% and loads were high (range = 48->9,000,000 copies). 
Frog survival during the 2014 summer was low, with an estimated 25% surviving at the time of the September visit (Figure 10A). 
Only a single adult was captured in 2015 and none in future years. 
Although second-year tadpoles were observed in 2015, the population declined to extirpation in subsequent years (Figure 10B, C). 

In Upper Basin, frogs were introduced to 10277 and were subsequently recaptured there and in 10276, 11359, 12361, and 12534. 
The introduced population showed very similar dynamics as Ruskin. 
In September 2013, all captured frogs remained Bd-negative, and visits in July and August 2014 indicated that although prevalence had increased slightly (13%), Bd loads remained very low (0-96 copies). 
Prevalence had increased markedly by the time of the September 2014 visit (71%), but loads were still relatively low (0-4272). 
By summer 2015, only a single adult was observed (Figure 11A) and its load was very high (>10^7), indicating that a Bd epizootic has occurred during the previous winter. 
A small number of tadpoles was observed in 2016, but the population declined to extirpation (Figure 11B, C). 

The long-term outcome of the frog introduction in Pinchot Basin was similar, but took longer to play out.
Frogs were introduced to 10315, and were subsequently capture there and in 10214 and 10216. 
A single frog was Bd-positive during the September 2013 visit (prevalence = 7%). During visits in 2014, 2015, and 2016, prevalence fluctuated widely (0-94%), but loads were always very low (0-1734 copies). 
During this period, survival of introduced adults was relatively high (Figure 12A), and the population declined slowly and by a similar amount each year (Figure 12B). 
Tadpoles were observed in 2015 and 2016.
The site was not visited in 2017, but in 2018 no adults were observed and Bd loads on tadpoles and subadults were generally very high (112-10^7 copies), suggesting that the adults had succumbed to a Bd epizootic sometime between September 2016 and July 2018. 
The population subsequently declined to extirpation (Figure 12B, C). 


## Reintroduction of adults from declining populations {-}

As described in "Critical Restoration Efforts Needed to Recover Endangered Mountain Yellow-legged Frogs in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks - Final Report - 2020"), reintroduction of captive-reared adults that originated from post-epizootic declining populations (Tyndall, Milestone, Sixty Lake, Pinchot) was relatively unsuccessful in reestablishing or augmenting populations, even when frogs were "immunized" against Bd. 
Most reintroduced populations declined quickly to extirpation or near-extirpation (lower Milestone, Sixty Lake, Pinchot), indicating that the survival of reintroduced frogs was very low regardless of whether they were “immunized” prior to release or not. 

The two populations reintroduced into the Tyndall watershed declined more slowly, thereby providing an opportunity to better assess differences in survival between Bd-exposed and control frogs.
At Tyndall Creek Pond, survival of reintroduced Bd-exposed frogs was somewhat higher than that of reintroduced control frogs, and the reintroduction appeared successful in increasing the size of the adult population and may also have increased recruitment of new adults. 
At Ranger Station Pond, Bd exposure did not affect post-release survival and the population declined to near extirpation within three years. 
The fact that reintroductions to both of these sites used frogs collected from the same donor population (Tyndall Creek Pond) suggests that biotic or abiotic characteristics of the reintroduction site have important effects on frog survival and the likelihood of population establishment. 
In addition, frogs obtained from the same population may show effects of immunization that differ between release locations. 
This suggests that any benefit of immunization may be overridden by site specific factors or site x Bd interactions. 


## Reintroduction of adults from persistent populations {-}

Results from frog translocations conducted in Yosemite indicate that the majority of translocations have resulted in population establishment, suggesting that reintroduction of frogs from persistent populations may be the most effective means of recovering frogs attempted so far. 
Recent analysis of all translocated populations indicated the importance of both adult survival and recruitment of new adults as key factors affecting whether translocated populations become established (Knapp and Joseph 2020). 
Results indicate that survival of translocated frogs is highly variable between sites, but is consistent within sites. 
Therefore, site-specific factors appear to be important drivers of frog survival, and these factors likely include habitat characteristics, and frog-Bd dynamics. 
Recruitment is also highly variable across sites and time. 
Although significant pulses of recruitment may occur only 1-2 times per decade at a site, these pulses have critically important and long-lasting effects on frog populations, including on the establishment of translocated populations.


# Discussion {-}

Given the threat to global amphibian biodiversity posed by Bd, the conclusion reached in a recent review of chytridiomycosis mitigation in the wild is alarming: “Despite decades of research into amphibian-chytrid host-pathogen biology, no effective method to reduce the impact of chytridiomycosis has emerged and been tested broadly in the field. 
A few case and proof-of-concept studies have produced mixed or limited success at best.” 

## Itraconazole treatment {-}

*Effect of treatment on zoospore pool*. Over the course of the 2010 field season in Dusy Basin, zoospore pools increased marginally in control lakes but not lakes where frogs were treated with itraconazole. 
This result is consistent with the hypothesis that reducing Bd loads of frogs reduces their zoospore release rates, which in turn affect the zoospore pool. 
However, the number of water samples that tested positive for Bd increased more in treatment lakes than controls. 
The latter result appears counter to our hypothesis, but is at least in part due to the fact that the initial (pre-treatment) number of positive samples was lower in treatment lakes than controls, biasing the state change for control lakes toward increase. 
[Tom/Roland, this was deliberate, right?] 
In addition, Bd-state data are not absolute due to lower limits of detection. 
The Bd-state data are therefore less reliable than the quantitative data, and we conclude that itraconazole treatment led to a smaller increase in zoospore pools over time.  

## Microbiome augmentation {-}

In addition to describing results of microbiome augmentation of subadults, briefly mention the augmentation conducted on adults by V. Vredenburg.

## Reintroduction of frogs from declining populations {-}

Reintroduction of frogs from post-epizootic declining populations, including those "immunized" against Bd, generally resulted in low survival. 
This suggests that using donor populations that are declining due to ongoing effects of Bd is unlikely to be an effective recovery strategy, even in the short term. 
Instead, whenever possible, donor populations should be those that are robust and have shown substantial recovery in the decades following Bd epizootics. Every such population in SEKI (e.g., Darwin Bench, McGee, Swamp Lake, Volcanic Lakes) and on surrounding national forests (e.g., Mulkey Meadows) should be used as a source of frogs for future reintroductions to the maximum extent possible.
Although relatively few such populations exist, they would nonetheless allow the recovery of frogs in many sites in the South Fork San Joaquin, Middle Fork Kings, and Kern River drainages from which frogs have been extirpated. Based on our current understanding, such efforts are likely to have a higher probability of success than efforts that utilize less robust donor populations.

Immediately prior to the exposure of frogs in the treated group to *J. lividum* on days 0 and 1, frogs in the treated group were treated with itraconazole to reduce their loads. Over the following three months, loads of the treated group increased and eventually returned to pre-treatment levels. Loads of control and wild frogs remained high throughout the three months. Therefore, itraconazole treatment followed by *J. lividum" exposure failed to suppress Bd loads over the longer term.
