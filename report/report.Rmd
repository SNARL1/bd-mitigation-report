# Abstract {-}

The recently-emerged amphibian chytrid fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd) has had an unprecedented impact on global amphibian populations, and highlights the urgent need to develop effective mitigation strategies. 
We conducted in-situ antifungal treatment experiments in wild populations of the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog during or immediately after Bd-caused mass die-off events. 
The objective of treatments was to reduce Bd infection intensity ("load") and in doing so alter frog-Bd dynamics and increase the probability of frog population persistence despite ongoing Bd infection. 
Experiments included treatment of early life stages (tadpoles and subadults) with the antifungal drug itraconazole, treatment of adults with itraconazole, and augmentation of the skin microbiome of subadults with *Janthinobacterium lividum*, a commensal bacterium with antifungal properties. 
All itraconazole treatments caused immediate reductions in Bd load, and produced longer-term effects that differed between life stages.
In experiments focused on early life stages, Bd load was reduced in the two months immediately following treatment and was associated with increased survival of subadults.
However, Bd load and frog survival returned to pre-treatment levels in less than one year, and treatment had no effect on population persistence. 
In adults, treatment reduced Bd load and increased frog survival over the three-year post-treatment period, consistent with frogs having developed an effective adaptive immune response against Bd. 
Despite this protracted period of reduced impacts of Bd on adults, recruitment into the adult population was limited and the population eventually declined to near-extirpation. 
In the microbiome augmentation experiment, bathing frogs in a *J. lividum* solution after Bd load reduction with itraconazole increased concentrations of this bacterium on frogs, but concentrations declined to baseline levels within one month and did not have a protective effect against Bd infection. 
Collectively, these results indicate that our mitigation efforts were ineffective in causing long-term changes in frog-Bd dynamics and increasing population persistence, due largely to the inability of early life stages to mount an effective immune response against Bd. 
This results in repeated recruitment failure and a low probability of population persistence in the face of ongoing Bd infection.

# Introduction {-}

Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly common in wildlife, often due to anthropogenic changes in the ecology of the host or pathogen [@daszak2000emerging; @cunningham2017one].
Impacts of disease on wildlife can be severe, including long-term population decline and even extinction, with far-reaching effects on species, communities, and ecosystems [@ostfeld2008infectious; @scheele2019amphibian].
Wildlife diseases can also spill over to humans and domestic animals [@alexander2018ecology]. Collectively, these impacts of emerging wildlife diseases have significant consequences to global biodiversity and public health [@daszak2000emerging]. 
As such, the ability to manage wildlife diseases is critically important. However, doing so is often challenging because wildlife diseases are poorly described, few intervention measures are available, and free ranging wildlife are inherently difficult to study and treat [@joseph2013taming]. 

One of the most destructive wildlife diseases in recorded history is the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (“Bd”). 
This recently-emerged pathogen [@ohanlon2018recent] is highly pathogenic to a wide range of amphibian taxa and, by one estimate, has caused the severe decline or extinction of at least 500 amphibian species [@scheele2019amphibian], with many more predicted to be at risk [@rodder2009global]. 
The pathogenesis of chytridiomycosis is the result of Bd infection disrupting cutaneous osmoregulatory function, leading to electrolyte imbalance and death [@voyles2009pathogenesis].
Bd infection is transferred between hosts via an aquatic flagellated zoospore stage [@longcore1999batrachochytrium]. 
Mechanisms facilitating the spread of Bd between amphibian populations are not well understood, but spatial spread is likely due in part to the dispersal of infected hosts [@vredenburg2010dynamics]. 

To reduce the impact of chytridiomycosis and increase the fraction of amphibian hosts that survive chytridiomycosis outbreaks, several mitigation measures have been proposed and tested. 
These include treating hosts with antifungal agents (i.e., drugs or antifungal symbiotic bacteria), treating the environment with antifungals, and reducing host density [@woodhams2011mitigating; @garner2016mitigating].
However, existing field trials indicate only short-term benefits to targeted populations and limited effectiveness in promoting host population persistence [@woodhams2012treatment; @garner2016mitigating].
Modeling also suggests that none of these approaches is likely to prevent Bd-driven population extirpation, but reducing Bd loads on individual hosts may have the greatest potential to produce a beneficial outcome [@drawert2017using].
Given the uncertainty regarding effectiveness of mitigation measures, there is a critical need for additional field trials. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of treatments applied to different host life stages, we took advantage of Bd epizootics occurring in populations of the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog.
Mountain yellow-legged ("MYL") frogs are emblematic of global amphibian declines, including those caused by Bd. 
The MYL frog is a complex of two closely-related species, *Rana muscosa* and *Rana sierrae*, endemic to the mountains of California and adjacent Nevada, USA [@vredenburg2007concordant].
During the past century, MYL frogs disappeared <!-- I don't love the word disappear because it sounds mysterious, which it isn't; however, the synonyms that I can currently think of, like 'were extirpated', require passive voice --> from more than 90% of their historical localities [@vredenburg2007concordant] and are now listed as “endangered” under the U.S. Endangered Species Act [@usfws2002determination; @usfws2014endangered]. 
In the Sierra Nevada portion of their range, the primary causes of decline are the introduction of nonnative fish into naturally fishless water bodies and, more recently, the spread of Bd [@knapp2000nonnative; @vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
MYL frogs are highly susceptible to chytridiomycosis.
Arrival of Bd in a naive population typically results in rapid increases in Bd prevalence and individual-level infection intensities ("load"), leading to subsequent mass frog mortality [@vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
Such epizootics generally extirpate affected frog populations, and hundreds of such extirpations have occurred in the past several decades as Bd spread across the Sierra Nevada [e.g., @rachowicz2006emerging; @vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
Examples of affected populations transitioning to an enzootic state, in which host populations and Bd coexist, are rare [@briggs2010enzootic]. 

The interaction between host and pathogen influences whether the host population is extirpated by an epizootic or transitions to an enzootic state. 
The results of @briggs2010enzootic indicate that in MYL frogs, host population extinction versus persistence can result solely from density-dependent host-pathogen dynamics. 
This suggests that reducing Bd loads (e.g., by lowering frog density or treating frogs with antifungal agents) could increase both frog survivorship and the likelihood of enzootic dynamics. 
An adaptive immune response by amphibians against Bd may also facilitate enzootic dynamics [@woodhams2011mitigating]. 
Early life stage amphibians have relatively low immunocompetence [@rollins1998metamorphosis; @grogan2018review], but adults of some species, including MYL frogs, can develop adaptive immune defenses that may be at least partially protective against Bd [@ellison2015more; @grogan2018evolution; @mcmahon2014amphibians].
In theory, antifungal treatments conducted in immunocompetent species and life satage during epizootics could slow the growth of Bd and allow the full development of adaptive immunity, which in turn could increase adult survival and population persistence [@woodhams2011mitigating]. 

The short duration of antifungal drug application may result in only limited suppression of Bd in hosts and a failure to change the fate of Bd-infected amphibian populations. 
However, a more sustained manipulation could produce longer-lasting outcomes (i.e., pulse versus press manipulations). 
One potential sustained manipulation involves imparting stronger antifungal properties to the skin microbiome of amphibian hosts [@woodhams2014interacting; @bletz2013mitigating]. 
The feasibility of such a manipulation is suggested by laboratory experiments in which augmentation of the skin microbiome with antifungal bacteria altered frog-Bd dynamics and increased frog survival [@harris2009skin; @kueneman2016probiotic; but see also @becker2011towards]. 
However, this approach is untested in wild amphibian populations.

Over a decade (2009-2018), we conducted six field trials to mitigate incipient or ongoing epizootics in previously disease naive *R. sierrae* populations (disease history was known from multiple years of skin swab collection [e.g., @vredenburg2010dynamics]). 
Trials included (1) two treatments of early life stages (tadpoles and recently metamorphosed subadults) with the antifungal drug itraconazole [@garner2009using], (2) three treatments of adults with itraconazole, and (3) one manipulation of the frog skin microbiome that involved exposing subadult frogs to *Janthinobacterium lividum*, a symbiotic bacterium that can occur on amphibian skin and has antifungal properties [@brucker2008amphibian]. 
Throughout all field trials, we predicted that the treatments would reduce Bd load on individuals, increase frog survivorship, and allow the long-term persistence of the treated population despite ongoing Bd infection (i.e., in an enzootic state). 
We present all six trials together here because the collective results highlight the repeatability of the outcomes, and provide important insights into mechanisms underlying those outcomes. 
These insights are essential for the development of effective mitigation measures against this devastating wildlife disease <!--[@scheele2019amphibian]-->.

# Methods {-}

The six field trials were conducted at sites located in the remote backcountry of Kings Canyon National Park and Inyo National Forest (California, USA), at elevations of 3150-3550 m. 
These sites are ten to 26 km from the nearest road, and all supplies were carried in and out on foot. 
In some cases, this remoteness and wilderness regulations constrained potential study designs. 

## Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

Bd-caused epizootics and resulting mass die-offs of *R. sierrae* occurred in Barrett Lakes Basin during 2005 to 2007 [@vredenburg2010dynamics] and in Dusy Basin in 2009 [@jani2017epidemic]. 
In an effort to prevent the extirpation of remnant populations, itraconazole treatments were conducted during mid-summer of 2009 in Barrett and 2010 in Dusy. 
Because adults typically succumb to chytridiomycosis early in an epizootic [@vredenburg2010dynamics], at the time of the experiments these populations contained primarily late-stage tadpoles and recently metamorphosed subadults. 
We used results from basin-wide visual encounter surveys (VES; see **Supporting Information** for details) conducted prior to the experiments to identify the largest remaining populations, and these assigned to treated and control groups at random. 
The Barrett experiment included three treated and three control populations, and in Dusy, where fewer frog populations remained extant, a total of three treated and two control populations were used (Table S1). 
Based on VES conducted before and during the treatments, we estimate that we treated 70-90% of each population.

medianstage <- median(stage$tad_stage)
# tibble::tibble(stats = c("min", "max", "median"),
#       vals = c(minstage, maxstage, medianstage))
```
In the Barrett experiment, during July 29 to August 1 we captured as many *R. sierrae* as possible from each pond assigned to the treated group and held them in large mesh pens anchored in the littoral zone of each pond (see **Supporting Information** for details). 
Immediately following capture, we collected skin swabs from a subset of animals to quantify Bd load [@vredenburg2010dynamics, additional details provided below]. <!-- Be more explicit about what details are provided in paranthetical text? -->
Swabbed tadpoles were also staged [@gosner1960simplified, tadpole stages included in experiment: range = `r minstage` -- `r maxstage`, median = `r medianstage`] and subadults were measured (snout-vent length) and weighed. 
Daily itraconazole treatments (see **Supporting Information** for details) were conducted during the period July 30 -- August 5, and animals were treated from four to seven times, depending on the day of capture. 
To assess treatment effectiveness in reducing Bd loads, we collected a second set of skin swabs from a subset of animals following the final treatment. 
A total of 977 tadpoles and 65 subadults were treated and released back into the study ponds. <!-- Add mortality info -->
In the control populations, we swabbed tadpoles and subadults on a single day (one population per day during August 2--4). To ensure that animals were not swabbed more than once, swabbed animals were held in pens until swabbing was complete. 
Swabs were collected from a total of 75 tadpoles and 23 subadults. 
To quantify the longer-term effects of treatment on Bd load and frog population dynamics, we conducted post-treatment VES and swabbing at each pond in August and September 2009, and in July, August, and September 2010. 
In treated populations, given that we were unable to capture all animals for treatment, animals swabbed during the post-treatment period likely included a mix of treated and untreated individuals. 

The Dusy experiment was identical in most respects to the Barrett experiment. During July 24--26, we captured as many animals as possible from the ponds assigned to the treated group and placed them in pens. 
Daily itraconazole treatments began on July 27 and lasted through August 2, resulting in seven days of treatment for all animals. 
In treated populations, swabs were collected from a subset of animals on July 27 before treatment began, and after the final treatment on August 2. 
A total of 3707 tadpoles and 125 subadults were treated. 
Animals in control populations were captured, swabbed, and released on July 29 (62 tadpoles and 18 subadults). 
We also collected water samples from all study ponds before and after the treatments to determine if treatment of frogs reduced the concentration of Bd zoospores in the ponds ["zoospore pool"; @briggs2010enzootic]; all associated methods and results are provided in **Supporting Information**.
To assess the longer-term effects of treatment on frog populations, we conducted follow-up VES in each pond in August and September 2010, and July and August 2011. 
As with the Barrett treatment, animals swabbed in treated populations during the post-treatment period likely included a mix of treated and untreated individuals. <!-- There is a lot of repetition between the Dusy and Barrett paragraphs. Can we reduce text by combining these paragraphs? --> 

## Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

*LeConte Basin*. In mid-summer 2015, routine disease surveillance at one of the largest remaining Bd-naive *R. sierrae* populations detected high Bd loads and the presence of many moribund and dead frogs. 
In response to this epizootic, we conducted two antifungal treatment experiments focused on adults, one in the lower portion of the basin and one in the upper portion (Table S1). 
The two basins are approximately 750 m apart and are linked by streams and relatively gentle terrain; we therefore expected some movement of frogs between them.

The design of the treatment experiments in the lower and upper basins was nearly identical, differing only in the number of days spent capturing frogs for the “treated” group (Table S2). 
To simplify logistics, frogs in the treated group were captured during the first 2-3 days of the experiment, and frogs for the untreated control group were captured on the following day. 
Frogs that were visibly sick (as indicated by an impaired righting reflex) were excluded because these frogs were likely within hours of death. 
In the lower basin, a total of 359 and 102 frogs were captured for the treated and control groups, respectively. 
In the upper basin, these totals were 206 and 74 frogs. 
Because of the large size of this population, these totals are likely a relatively small proportion of the total frog population in the basin. 

Immediately following capture, frogs were swabbed, tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to allow identification of individuals [@joseph2018disease], measured, and weighed. Following processing, frogs in the treated category were held in capture date-specific pens for the duration of the 8-9 day treatment period and control frog were released (see **Supporting Information** for details). 
To determine treatment effectiveness, 93 frogs in the lower basin (31 from each capture date) and 50 frogs in the upper basin (25 from each capture date) were re-swabbed on the day prior to the final treatment. 
After the last treatment, all frogs were released from the pens. 

Post-treament frog survival was quantified using capture-mark-recapture (CMR) surveys [@joseph2018disease] conducted during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018. 
No post-treatment surveys were possible in 2015 because the frog active season was nearly over by the time the treatments were completed. 
CMR surveys were conducted during 1--3 visits to the study lakes per summer (i.e., primary periods). 
During each primary period, all frog populations were surveyed on each of three consecutive days (except the final period in 2018 when only a one-day survey was conducted). 
During each daily survey, any adult frogs observed were captured, identified via their PIT tag, and released. 
When captured for the first time during a primary period, frogs were also swabbed, measured, and weighed. 
Any untagged frogs captured during the surveys (i.e., frogs that were not part of the initial treatment phase of the experiment; “non-experimental”) were tagged and processed as described above.

*Treasure Lake*. In July 2018, we conducted an antifungal treatment of adult *R. sierrae* in the Treasure Lakes basin (Table S1). 
Unlike the LeConte treatments, this treatment was conducted as a management action instead of an experiment due to the advanced stage of the epizootic and the resulting small number of adults remaining in the population.
As such, all methods and results are provided in  **Supporting Information**. 

## Microbiome augmentation of subadults {-}

By 2012, the Bd epizootic in Dusy Basin (see **Methods - Itraconazole treatment of early life stages**) had caused the extirpation of most *R. sierrae* populations. 
Extant populations contained only late-stage tadpoles and recently metamorphosed subadults, and given the absence of any adults, were presumed to represent the final cohorts at these sites. 
In July 2012, we initiated an experiment focused on subadults at a single pond to test the combined effect of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* augmentation on Bd load and frog survival. 
This pond was also used in the 2010 experiment in which early life stages were treated with itraconazole (Table S1). 

The experiment included a treated group (itraconazole treatment followed by *J. lividum* exposure) and a control group (no itraconazole, no *J. lividum*). 
In designing this experiment, we assumed that any effect of probiotic bacteria would result from protection provided to relatively lightly infected frogs from Bd colonization, and not from reducing the intensity of established heavy infections (R. Harris, personal communication). 
Therefore, given that subadults in the study population had high Bd loads, prior to exposing frogs to *J. lividum* we reduced their Bd loads with a 7-day itraconazole treatment. We did not test independent effects of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* augmentation due to the limited number of subadults available at the study pond. 

Subadults were captured on July 12-13 (n = 331), measured, weighed, and assigned at random to treated and control groups at a ratio of approximately 4:1 (271 treated, 60 control). 
This ratio was chosen to maximize the number of subadults receiving antifungal treatment while maintaining a sufficiently large control group. 
All animals were given group-specific toe-clips: (i) control = toe 2 on left front foot, and (ii) itraconazole + *J. lividum* = toe 2 on right front foot. 
We used toe clips because PIT tags are too large to be used with subadults, and other tagging methods tested in pre-experiment trials gave unsatisfactory results [e.g., @brannelly2014comparison]. 
Following processing, subadults in the treated and control groups were held in separate mesh pens. 
To determine pre-itraconazole Bd loads, a subset of subadults from both groups were swabbed on July 12, and all control animals were released back into the study pond on July 13. Itraconazole treatments were conducted daily on July 12-18 (see **Supporting Information** for details). 
The number of animals in the treated group declined somewhat during this period due to Bd-caused mortality and occasional predation by gartersnakes <!--provide specifics-->. 

Immediately prior to the first *J. lividum* bath, we swabbed a subset of itraconazole-treated frogs to estimate their background level of *J. lividum*.
*J. lividum* for use in the experiment was obtained from the skin of an adult *R. sierrae* in Dusy Basin in 2009 and cultured using standard methods [@harris2009skin]. 
On July 19, a concentrated solution of *J. lividum* culture was transported into Dusy Basin on foot in an insulated container.
On July 19 and again on July 20, we bathed all itraconazole-treated subadults (n = 256) in a solution of *J. lividum* culture for 4-4.5 hours (75 and 150 mL of *J. lividum* culture per liter of lake water on July 19 and 20, respectively). 
At the conclusion of the second *J. lividum* bath, all animals were released back into the pond and the solution of *J. lividum* culture was carried out of the backcountry and disposed of.
Because the survival of *J. lividum* during the two day period of transport and holding is unknown and we were unable to make counts of live cells in the field, the concentration of *J. lividum* to which frogs were exposed is also unknown. 

To evaluate the effects of the combined itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment, we surveyed the study population during the summers of 2012 (n = 3 surveys), 2013 (n = 3), 2014 (n = 1), and 2019 (n = 1). 
During each of these surveys, we conducted VES and captured and swabbed as many subadult frogs as possible (no adults were captured), and recorded the toe-clip (if present) for each individual. 
The concentration of *J. lividum* on captured frogs was assessed using skin swabs and qPCR (see **Supporting Information** for details). 

## Quantifying Bd load using skin swabs {-}

We quantified Bd load using standard swabbing and quantitative PCR methods [@boyle2004rapid; @hyatt2007diagnostic]. 
We defined Bd load as the number of ITS1 copies per swab [see @joseph2018disease for details]. 
In post-metamorphic *R. sierrae*, Bd loads indicative of severe chytridiomycosis are $\geq$ 600,000 ITS copies [= 5.8 ITS copies on a log~10~ scale; @vredenburg2010dynamics; @joseph2018disease].

## Statistical analyses {-} 

We analyzed treatment results with linear simple and multilevel models in a Bayesian framework. 
All analyses except one used the brms package in R [@bürkner2017rpackage; @bürkner2018advanced; @rsoftware2020]. 
The exception was the analysis of the CMR data collected as part of the itraconazole treatments in LeConte Basin. 
The LeConte CMR model was implemented in Stan [@carpenter2017stan] directly instead of via the brms interface. See **Supporting Information** for details. 

The models described in subsequent sections are the best-fit models that resulted from the workflow outlined in **Supporting Information**. 
We considered predictors of group- and population-level effects and family-specific parameters to be important when the 95% credible interval ("CI") of the estimates did not include zero, and relatively unimportant otherwise. 
We provide the results of all analyses in tabular form, either in the Results section for analyses describing the outcome of treatment experiments, or in **Supporting Information** for related but less central analyses. 
To interpret the coefficients from negative binomial models, note that there is a log link for the mean (and therefore Bd load data is on a log scale). In addition, for zero-inflated negative binomial models, there is a logit link for the zero-inflation component. 
The key results from treatment experiments are also visualized using boxplots or dotplots (when samples sizes were large or relatively small, respectively). 
When relevant, sample sizes are displayed above the x-axis of each plot. 
In plots where sample sizes are displayed, the lack of sample size information for a particular group indicates that this group was intentionally not included in surveys and/or sampling. 
In contrast, a sample size of zero ("n=0") indicates that this group was included in surveys and/or sampling, but that no individuals were available for capture and sampling.

### Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

For both experiments, we predicted that itraconazole treatment would reduce Bd loads and increase the survival of frogs during and after metamorphosis. In turn, this would result in more subadults counted during VES conducted in treated versus control populations in the year of and the year following treatment. As such, our analyses focused on two questions: During the one-year period following the treatments, did itraconazole treatment influence (1) Bd loads and (2) survival of treated animals? 
To address the first question, we developed separate models to describe (i) pre-treatment differences in Bd loads of the animals assigned to the treated and control groups, (ii) immediate effects of treatment on Bd loads, and (iii) treatment effects on post-release Bd loads in the year of treatment and the following year.
Because the treatments in Barrett and Dusy Basins were virtually identical in their design, we combined the results from both experiments into a single dataset, and included basin as a predictor variable in models to account for any between-basin differences.

We evaluated pre-treatment differences in Bd load between treated and control groups using the model *bd_load ~ (treatment x basin)* (family = negative binomial, treatment = [treated, control], basin = [Barrett, Dusy]). 
Life stage (tadpole, subadult) was not included in the model as a predictor because life stage and basin were collinear (i.e., most ponds were dominated by tadpoles but a few contained mostly subadults), and as such we could not estimate their separate effects. 
Adding a group-level effect of site_id did not improve model fit, indicating that between-pond differences were unimportant.

The immediate effect of treatment on Bd load was assessed using the model *bd_load ~ stage + (trt_period x basin)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, stage = [tadpole, subadult], trt_period = [begin, end of treatment period]). 
We were able to include life stage in this model because many tadpoles metamorphosed into subadults during the treatment, producing a more balanced representation of life stages across sites. 
Plots of conditional effects suggested substantial differences in Bd load variation between life stages, treatment categories, and basins. 
Therefore, the overdispersion parameter was modeled as a function of all three predictor variables. <!-- Explain why stage variable is okay to use. Lack of independence suggested by reviewer not the case because of minimal overlap between animals swabbed at beginning and end of treatment -->

The effect of treatment on post-release Bd loads was evaluated using the model *bd_load ~ stage + basin + (year_std x treatment) + (1 | site_id)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, year_std is a dummy variable in which 0 = year of treatment and 1 = year after treatment, site_id included as a group-level effect). 
Plots of conditional effects suggested substantial differences in Bd load variation between life stages, basins, years, and treatment groups, and therefore the overdispersion parameter was modeled as a function of all four predictor variables. 

The effect of treatment on subsequent subadult counts was assessed using the model *count ~ basin + ltadpole + (std_year x treatment) + (1 | site_id)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, count = number of subadults counted during a post-treatment VES, ltadpole = number of tadpoles counted (log~10~ transformed) during the same VES, site_id included as a group-level effect). 
The count of subadults served as a proxy for subadult survival, which could not be estimated directly (see **Methods - Microbiome augmentation of subadult frogs** for details). We included the tadpole count variable to account for differences between ponds in potential subadult production due to differences in the number of tadpoles. 

### Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

*LeConte Basin*. To estimate pre-treatment differences in Bd loads of frogs assigned to the treated and control groups, we used the model *bd_load ~ (location x group)* (family = negative binomial, location = [lower, upper], group = [treated, control]). 
To evaluate the immediate effect of treatment on Bd loads, we used the model *bd_load ~ (location x trt_period)* (family = negative binomial, trt_period = [begin, end of treatment period]). 
For both analyses, we excluded any frogs that died during the treatment period. 
We evaluated differences in Bd loads of frogs that lived versus died during the treatment period using the model *trt_died ~ (lbd_load x location)* (family = bernoulli, trt_died = [true, false], lbdload = log~10~(bd_load + 1) on swabs collected immediately prior to the treatment period).

To describe post-treatment frog population dynamics, including survival and recruitment, while accounting for imperfect detection, we used open population multi-state hidden Markov models (see **Supporting Information** for details).
Briefly, we estimated population size over time using parameter-expanded Bayesian data augmentation, which augments the capture histories of observed individuals with a large number of capture histories for individuals that were never detected [@royle2012parameter].
The states included (1) “not recruited”, (2) “alive at the upper site”, (3) “alive at the lower site”, and (4) “dead”. 
On any particular survey, we considered three possible observations of an individual: (1) “alive at the upper site”, (2) “alive at the lower site”, and (3) “not detected”. 
The model structure builds on the work of @joseph2018disease, tracking individual Bd loads over time, allowing the expected Bd load (log~10~(Bd load + 1)) to vary as a function of treatment and time, and allowing the effect of Bd load on survival to vary as a function of treatment. 

### Microbiome augmentation of subadults
To assess the effectiveness of itraconazole treatment in reducing Bd loads over the 7-day treatment period and to quantify the amount of *J. lividum* present naturally on subadults in this population, we swabbed a subset of animals on July 19 immediately prior to *J. lividum* exposure. 
To compare pre-treatment Bd loads on frogs assigned to the treated and control groups, we used the model *bd_load ~ expt_trt* (family = negative binomial, expt_trt = [treated, control]). 
The effectiveness of the itraconazole treatment was assessed with the model *bd_load ~ days* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, days = -7 (before treatment) and 0 (after treatment)). 

We analyzed the post-treatment data to determine whether subadults exposed to the combined itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment had (1) higher concentrations of *J. lividum* and lower Bd loads than untreated control animals and non-experimental ("wild") animals, and (2) higher survival than control animals. 
All analyses focused on data collected during the two months immediately following the 2012 treatment. 
Recaptures of control animals quickly declined to near zero, thereby precluding formal comparisons of *J. lividum* and Bd load in the treated versus control groups.
We were able to compare treated versus wild frogs, but importantly, unlike the treated and control groups that each contained a single cohort of toe-clipped animals that was repeatedly sampled over time, membership of animals in the wild group changed over time as new individuals entered the group following metamorphosis and previously-metamorphosed individuals died. 
Given this limitation, we describe the *J. lividum* concentration and Bd load on treated versus control animals graphically only.
We analyzed the *J. lividum* concentration on treated versus wild frogs using the model *jliv ~ (days x frog_group)* (family = negative binomial, days = days since *J. lividum* exposure, frog_group = [treated, wild]). 
To describe Bd loads of treated versus wild frogs, we used the model *bd_load ~ (days x frog_group)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial). 
For the second question, we used the percent of animals in each group that were recaptured as a proxy for survival. 
Formal assessment of the effect of treatment on survival was again not possible due to the rapid disappearance of animals in the control group, so the results are described graphically only. 


# Results {-}

## Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

In the Barrett and Dusy experiments, immediately before itraconazole treatments began, Bd loads of animals in ponds assigned to the treated and control groups were similar (Figure 1: Week -3 and -1). 
Model results (Table S3) confirmed that Bd load did not differ between treatment groups. In addition, basin had a weak effect (loads were lower in Dusy than Barrett), and the (treatment x basin) interaction term was unimportant, indicating that the patterns of Bd load between treated and control groups were similar in both basins. 

The treatments reduced Bd loads by 1.8 orders of magnitude in Barrett and 6.1 orders of magnitude in Dusy (Figure 1: Week -1 versus 0). 
Model results (Table S4) substantiated the important effect of treatment period ("trt_period"; lower after treatment than before treatment). 
In addition, important effects on Bd load were also evident for frog life stage (lower in tadpoles than subadults), basin (higher in Dusy than Barrett), and the (basin x trt_period) interaction term. 
The importance of the interaction term indicated that loads were higher in Dusy than Barrett at the beginning of the treatment, but lower in Dusy than Barrett at the end of treatment (Figure 1). 
Finally, life stage, treatment period, and basin all had important effects on the overdispersion parameter (Table S4; Bd load was more variable in subadults than tadpoles, at the beginning than the end of the treatment period, and in Dusy than Barrett).

After release of the treated animals back into the study ponds, the reduction in Bd load in treated versus control groups that was evident at the end of the treatment period persisted for at least the next 1.5 months (Figure 1: Week > 0). 
Results from a model of predictors of Bd load over the 1-year post-release period (Table 1) showed important effects on Bd load of most predictor variables, including treatment (treated lower than control), life stage (lower in tadpoles than subadults), year (lower in the year following treatment (year 1) than the year of treatment (year 0)), and the (year x treatment) interaction term. 
Basin did not have an important effect. 
The (year x treatment) term indicated that Bd loads were lower in the treated group than the control group in year 0, but by year 1 loads in the treated group had increased such that Bd loads of the treated and control groups were similar. 
Therefore, although the treatment effect was evident for more than a month, Bd loads on animals in treated populations returned to pre-treatment levels in the year following treatment (Figure 1). 
All predictors of the overdispersion parameter had important effects. 

The reduction in Bd load caused by the treatment was associated with increased counts of subadults in treated versus control populations (Figure 2).
Model results (Table 2) indicated that treatment and the (year x treatment) interaction term had important effects. 
The effects of tadpole count, basin, and year were unimportant. 
The interaction term indicated that treated populations had higher subadult counts than control populations in the year of the treatment, but that counts in treated populations in the year following treatment were low and similar to those in control populations (Figure 2). 
Therefore, mirroring the longer-term effects of treatment on Bd load, the increase in subadult counts in treated populations in the 1.5 months following treatment was no longer evident in the year following treatment. 


## Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

### LeConte Basin {-}

In the two itraconazole treatment experiments conducted in LeConte Basin, prior to the treatment period, adult *R. sierrae* assigned to the treated and control groups had very high Bd loads, above the level at which symptoms of severe chytridiomycosis are evident (Figure 3). 
Bd loads in the control group were somewhat higher than in the treated group, likely because control frogs were captured and processed 1-3 days later than frogs assigned to the treated group (Table S2) and during a period when Bd loads were increasing in the study populations. Model results (Table S6) affirmed an important pre-treatment difference in Bd load between treatment groups (treated groups lower than control groups).
Location and the (treatment x location) interaction term were both unimportant, with the latter indicating that the pattern of Bd load between treatment groups was similar in the lower and upper basins. 

Samples collected one day prior to the end of the 8-9 day treatment period (Table S2) indicated that in both experiments the treatment reduced Bd loads on treated frogs by 1.4-2.7 orders of magnitude (Figure 3). 
Model results (Table S7) corroborated the important effect of treatment on Bd load. 
The effect of location was also important (higher in the upper than lower basin), as was the (location x trt_period) interaction term, with the latter indicating that Bd loads before and at the end of treatment were both higher in the upper than lower basin. 

During the treatment period, 74 of the lower basin treated frogs and 80 of the upper basin treated frogs died. 
All control frogs survived during the several hour period between capture, processing, and release.
Of the treated frogs that died, most did so during the first half of the treatment period (lower basin: 73%; upper basin: 74%), consistent with frogs succumbing to chytridiomycosis. 
However, Bd load was not an important predictor of whether frogs died versus survived (Table S8). 
Location and the (location x bd_load) interaction term were also unimportant. 

During the three year post-treatment period across both experiments, 54% of treated frogs and 1% of control frogs were recaptured. 
We also captured 619 "non-experimental" frogs that were not part of the original treatment experiment. 
These frogs could have either survived the 2015 Bd epizootic as adults or recruited into the adult population after the epizootic. 
Frogs in this group spanned a broad range of sizes (40--75 mm, median = 50 mm), and 83% were larger than the 40--45 mm range that characterizes recent adult *R. sierrae* recruits.
In addition, all of the larger untagged frogs (> 45 mm) were captured in 2016, and all frogs captured in 2017 and 2018 were in the 40--45 mm range. <!-- Move details about non-experimental frogs to SI? -->

Importantly, the reduced loads of the treated group after the 2015 treatment period were maintained in all three post-treatment years (Figure 4a). 
Bd load dynamics in control frogs are less clear because only two control frogs were recaptured during 2016-2018. 
However, these two recaptured control frogs were recaptured in the year after the treatments (2016), and both had relatively low loads in 2015 relative to the rest of the individuals in the control group (Figure 4a). 
During the 2016-2018 period, Bd loads in the non-experimental group were relatively low and similar to those of the treated group. 

Overall, the LeConte adult population declined in abundance from 2015 to 2018, with the most rapid declines in the control group (Figure 4b). 
Between the end of the treatments in 2015 and the first surveys of 2016, the number of animals surviving in the control group dropped from 176 to `r ctrl_abund$med[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 2]` (CI: `r ctrl_abund$lo[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 2]` -- `r ctrl_abund$hi[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 2]`). 
By the end of the summer in 2016, the posterior median for the number of surviving control animals was `r ctrl_abund$med[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 4]` (CI: `r ctrl_abund$lo[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 4]` -- `r ctrl_abund$hi[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 4]`). 
The rate of decline was slower in both the treated and non-experimental groups (Figure 4b).
Nonetheless, despite the treatment, by 2018 the study populations in the lower and upper basins had declined to few remaining adults. 
In the last primary period of 2018, the posterior median for the number of treated frogs alive across both basins was `r trt_2018$med` (CI: `r trt_2018$lo` -- `r trt_2018$hi`), `r new_2018$med` for non-experimental frogs (CI: `r new_2018$lo` -- `r new_2018$hi`), and zero for controls (CI: 0 -- 0). 

Interestingly, Bd load had a stronger negative effect on survival in the control group relative to the treated and non-experimental groups (posterior probabilities = `r survival_diff$ctrl_lt_trt` and `r survival_diff$ctrl_lt_new`, for control versus treated, and control versus non-experimental, respectively; Figure 4c). 
This was the case despite considerable overlap in Bd loads between the control and treated/nonexperimental groups (Figure 4a, 4c). 

```{r load-detection-probs, include=FALSE}
p_df <- readr::read_csv(here::here("out", "detection_prob_summary.csv"))
highest_p <- dplyr::slice_max(p_df, med, n = 1)
lowest_p <- dplyr::slice_min(p_df, med, n = 1)
mean_p <- readr::read_csv(here::here("out", "mean_p.csv"))
```

Detection probabilities in the study populations varied over time, but overall were comparable to estimates previously reported from other populations [@joseph2018disease]. 
The primary period with the highest detection probabilities had a posterior median detection probability of `r highest_p$med` (CI: `r highest_p$lo`, `r highest_p$hi`). 
In contrast, the primary period with the lowest detection probabilities had a posterior median of `r lowest_p$med` (CI: `r lowest_p$lo`, `r lowest_p$hi`).
On an average primary period, posterior median detection probability was `r mean_p$med` (CI: `r mean_p$lo`, `r mean_p$hi`). <!-- Move code block and paragraph to SI -->

## Microbiome augmentation of subadults {-}

In the 2012 Dusy Basin microbiome augmentation experiment, prior to the itraconazole treatment, Bd loads were similar in subadults assigned to the control and treated groups (Figure 6: day = -7).
Model results (Table S11) affirmed that pre-treatment Bd loads of the two groups were not different. 
Itraconazole treatment reduced Bd loads almost four orders of magnitude (Figure 6: day -7 versus 0), and model results (Table S12) substantiated this important effect. 

*J. lividum* exposure started on the day following the last day of itraconazole treatment, and on that day *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults assigned to the treated group were either zero or near-zero for all individuals (day 0; Figure 7). 
Twelve days after the two *J. lividum* baths to which animals in the treated group were subjected, *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults were high, but unexpectedly the concentrations were similarly high in treated, control, and wild groups instead of only in the treated group (day 0 versus 12; Figure 7).
This is consistent with transfer of *J. lividum* from treated animals to other frogs in the pond that had not been treated with itraconazole or bathed experimentally in high concentrations of *J. lividum*. 
However, over the following two months, *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults in all three groups declined to near baseline levels (Figure 7). 
Formal comparison of *J. lividum* concentrations from day 12 to day 56 across all three groups was not possible due to the almost complete absence of control frogs on days 37 and 56. 
However, a model that included the treated and wild groups indicated an important negative effect of the number of days since *J. lividum* exposure on *J. lividum* concentration, but no effect of group or the (day x group) interaction term (Table 3). 
Therefore, *J. lividum* concentrations declined over the 2-month period and at similar rates in both treated and wild frogs. 

Following release of frogs in the treated group (itraconazole-treated and *J. lividum*-exposed) back into the study pond, their Bd loads increased steadily and reached pre-treatment levels after two months (Figure 6: day 56). 
Due to the rapid loss of frogs in the control group, formal comparison of Bd loads from day 12 to day 56 across all three groups was not possible. 
However, a model that included the treated and wild groups indicated that Bd loads increased during this period, and that Bd loads of wild frogs were higher than those of treated frogs (Table 4). 
In addition, there was an important effect of the (days x group) interaction term, due to increasing loads of treated frogs versus relatively constant loads of wild frogs. 
Together, these results indicate that the combined effect of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* exposure was ineffective in preventing the increase in Bd loads to pre-treatment levels. 
Increased concentrations of *J. lividum* on control and wild frogs also had no obvious effect on Bd load. 

During the three surveys of the study population conducted in 2012, the percent of frogs in the treated and control groups that were recaptured declined, but the rate of decline was steeper in the control versus treated group (Figure 8). 
Although no formal analysis is possible due to the relatively few sample points, the results suggest that the itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment increased frog survival over the two month period following treatment. 
Nonetheless, during surveys conducted in 2013 (one year after treatment), only a single experimental (i.e., toe-clipped) animal was captured. 
This animal was detected during a survey conducted in early summer, and was a member of the treated group. 
No *R. sierrae* of any life stage were detected during surveys in 2014 and 2019. 
In conclusion, the combined itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* exposure did not protect frogs against Bd infection and increase survival sufficiently to allow persistence of this population over the longer-term. 

# Discussion {-}

<!--The devastating effect of chytridiomycosis on amphibian populations worldwide [@scheele2019amphibian] highlights the need for effective strategies to mitigate disease impacts in the wild following Bd emergence. 
Potential strategies include those aimed at eliminating Bd or facilitating host-pathogen coexistence [@garner2016mitigating]. 
Complete eradication of Bd from amphibians and the environment will rarely be feasible, but in an isolated and simple ecosystem, treatment of all amphibians and chemical disinfection of aquatic habitats eliminated Bd over the long term [@bosch2015successful]. 
Similar methods applied to a more complex system failed to achieve long-term eradication of Bd [@fernandez2020situ]. 

Although many examples exist of Bd infection and resulting disease driving amphibian hosts to extinction or near-extinction [@scheele2019amphibian], amphibian-Bd coexistence is also possible. 
Coexistence can result from multiple mechanisms [@brannelly2021mechanisms].
Of these, wildlife disease management interventions often target density-dependent transmission and host resistance/tolerance [@woodhams2011mitigating; @garner2016mitigating].
Reducing amphibian density or treating amphibians with antifungal agents could reduce density-dependent transmission rates, and result in increased survival and population persistence in an enzootic state [@briggs2010enzootic]. 
In immunocompetent species and life stages [@grogan2018review; @rollins1998metamorphosis], treatment could increase host resistance or tolerance by reducing Bd growth and allowing the full development of adaptive immunity, possibly increasing survival and population persistence [@woodhams2011mitigating]. 
Host resistance or tolerance might also be increased by augmenting the microbiome on amphibian skin with antifungal probiotics that provide at least partial protection against Bd infection [@harris2009skin; @bletz2013mitigating]. 

Numerous field trials have been conducted to test these possibilities, but most have failed to increase the long-term persistence and growth of affected amphibian populations [@garner2016mitigating]. 
Treatment of larval or post-metamorphic frogs with antifungal drugs has been attempted in several species, and generally produces short-term reductions in Bd prevalence or load and, in some cases, increases in frog survival [@geiger2017antifungal; @hudson2016situ; @hardy2015itraconazole]. 
However, these effects typically disappear within weeks or months of treatment, with little consequence for long-term population persistence [but see @hardy2015itraconazole for a possible exception].
Laboratory experiments in which the frog skin microbiome was augmented with antifungal probiotics have demonstrated the potential of this method [@harris2009skin; @kueneman2016probiotic], but field trials are lacking. -->

I suggest removing  preceding paragraphs to address reviewer comments about length and clarity.

The following paragraph can be a new, shorter, more summary-like opening for the Discussion.
-->

The six field trials we conducted failed to facilitate coexistence of wild mountain yellow-legged frog hosts and the Bd pathogen over the scale of 1-5 years. Although we universally succeeded in reducing Bd loads on individual frogs during antifungal treatments and in subsequent weeks, the outcome of our interventions was no different than outcomes in hundreds of wild populations where no interventions have occurred: the experimental populations declined to local extirpation following the Bd epizootic. 
<!--This difficulty in altering frog-Bd dynamics is consistent with theoretical work that suggests a narrow range of conditions parameter space within which treatment strategies might prevent Bd-driven host extinctions [@drawert2017using].--> <!--Well, what are these narrow conditions?-->
Other studies of in-situ interventions during Bd epizootics in wild amphibian populations have generally failed to increase the long-term persistence of the host populations [@garner2016mitigating]. 
<!--As in the trials described here, treatment of larval or post-metamorphic frogs with antifungal drugs has been attempted in several species. -->
These other trials produced short-term reductions in Bd prevalence or load and, in some cases, increased frog survival [@geiger2017antifungal; @hudson2016situ; @hardy2015itraconazole]. 
These effects typically  disappeared within weeks or months of treatment, and did not enhance long-term frog population persistence [but see @hardy2015itraconazole for a possible exception], mirroring our results. 
Nonetheless, compared to disinfecting a habitat or reducing host density, antifungal treatment of individual hosts is predicted to have the greatest likelihood of a beneficial outcome in reducing the impact of a Bd epizootic [@drawert2017using], and is therefore worthy of detailed evaluation and continued refinement. 
<!--In the following sections we summarize the key results from our treatments and highlight the likely causes of the failure to facilitate long-term population persistence. -->

## Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

The two itraconazole treatment experiments that focused on early life stage *R. sierrae* (Dusy and Barrett basins) produced parallel longer-term outcomes, indicating high repeatability between basins and years. 

The short and long-term outcome of both experiments was a reduction in Bd loads on individuals even as the duration of antifungal treatment varied, but loads rebounded, and  the treatments ultimately failed to prevent extirpation of the population. 
<!-- The similar outcomes also suggest that the differences in number of itraconazole treatments to which study animals were exposed in the Barrett and Dusy experiments (4-7 versus seven treatments per population, respectively) had little if any effect on longer-term treatment results. 
In both basins, Bd loads were reduced in treated populations and remained relatively low during the summer in which the treatment was conducted.
In addition, this reduction in Bd load was associated with increased survival of subadults (as measured by increased numbers of subadults counted during VES). 
However, treatment effects were short-lived. 
Within a year, Bd loads returned to the high levels characteristic of the control populations, and subadult survival was reduced to zero or near-zero. 
In addition, the short-term increase in subadult survival did not increase recruitment into the adult population, and all control and treated populations in both basins were eventually extirpated. -->
<!--Removed above text because it is very summary, and should be clear from Results -->
The disappearance of any treatment effect within one year is similar to that reported by @geiger2017antifungal following antifungal treatment of tadpoles of the common midwife toad (*Alytes obstetricans*), and is consistent with tadpoles and subadults having relatively low immunocompetence [@bakar2016susceptibility; @grogan2018review]. 
@hardy2015itraconazole treated recently-metamorphosed Cascades frogs (*Rana cascadae*) with itraconazole, and reported increased survival of treated animals the following year. 
This relatively long-term benefit of antifungal treatment was not observed in either of our early life stage treatments, perhaps indicative of variation in immunocompetence of this life stage between even closely-related species. 
<!--new:-->
At least for amphibian species in which early life stages have low immunocompetence with respect to Bd, mitigation measures may need to prioritize on adults.

## Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

<!--The definition and result of resistance is not clear to me in this paragraph, as worded... Is resistance the result of maintenance of lower loads over years following treatment? Tolerance was clearly explained though.-->
In contrast to the relatively short-lived effects when early life stages were treated, two of the antifungal treatment experiments using *R. sierrae* adults (in LeConte) suggested a positive effect on disease resistance and tolerance (see @schneider2008two and @soares2017disease for recent reviews of resistance, tolerance, and the role of adaptive immunity in both). 
The sustained reduction in individual Bd loads may indicate that treated frogs developed disease resistance. 
That conclusion is supported by the similarity of the loads sustained by treated adults to the loads sustained by adults in persistent MYL frog populations characterized by enzootic Bd dynamics [@joseph2018disease; @briggs2010enzootic; @knapp2011nowhere].
The results also indicate that treated frogs had higher tolerance of Bd infection.
Specifically, for treated and control individuals with similar Bd loads, treated frogs had higher survival than control frogs; this higher survival at a given Bd load value is consistent with increased tolerance of Bd infection.
This enhanced resistance and tolerance suggest that treated frogs mounted an adaptive immune response against Bd [@ellison2015more; @grogan2018evolution; @mcmahon2014amphibians]. 

<!--original-->
<!--In contrast to the relatively short-lived effects when early life stages were treated, the two itraconazole treatment experiments in LeConte that focused on *R. sierrae* adults reduced Bd load and increased frog survival throughout the three-year post-treatment period of the study. 
The reduced Bd loads on treated adults were similar in magnitude to those of adults in persistent MYL frog populations characterized by enzootic Bd dynamics [@joseph2018disease; @briggs2010enzootic; @knapp2011nowhere].
In addition to increased resistance, the results also indicate that treated frogs had higher tolerance of Bd infection (see @schneider2008two and @soares2017disease for recent reviews of resistance, tolerance, and the role of adaptive immunity in both). 
Specifically, although treated frogs had lower loads than control frogs throughout the post-treatment period, Bd load distributions for frogs in the two groups nonetheless overlapped.
In the region of overlap (3.6--7.6 copies), survival probability was near zero for control frogs, but was higher and relatively constant for treated frogs. 
This higher survival at a given Bd load value is consistent with increased tolerance of Bd infection and, along with increased resistance, is suggestive of treated frogs having mounted an effective adaptive immune response against Bd [@ellison2015more; @grogan2018evolution; @mcmahon2014amphibians]. -->

<!--This is relatively resulty-->
<!--Despite the extended period of reduced Bd loads and increased frog survival, the adult population declined in each of the post-treatment years, and by 2018 few treated frogs remained. 
This decline was likely due to a combination of reduced adult survival and insufficient recruitment of new adults. 
Survival of treated adults, although higher than that for control frogs--> <!--(annual survival for 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 = 0.56, 0.17, and 0.31, respectively)--><!--, was generally still lower than that of most persisting enzootic MYL frog populations [@joseph2018disease; @briggs2010enzootic].
Regarding recruitment, we counted hundreds of tadpoles and subadults during VES conducted during each of the post-treatment years (maximum counts during 2016, 2017, and 2018 = 614, 2434, and 480, respectively), but captured relatively few new adult recruits during the same period. 
Of the 102 untagged (i.e., non-experimental) adults we captured that had sizes typical of new recruits (40--45 mm), 91 were tagged in 2016, nine in 2017, and two in 2018. 
The low recruitment of new adults in 2017 and 2018 despite large numbers of early life stages resembles recruitment levels we have observed in other enzootic *R. sierrae* populations, and is likely a consequence of high chytridiomycosis-caused mortality of frogs during and soon after metamorphosis [@joseph2018disease, and results from Barrett and Dusy treatments described above].
Whether this recruitment bottleneck was more severe in the LeConte population than in persistent enzootic MYL frog populations remains an important unanswered question. -->

<!--R2 requests a comment/citation about frog longevity; that seems worthwhile-->
Despite the apparent ability of antifungal treatment to facilitate an adaptive immune response and enhance resistance and tolerance, the adult population declined in each of the post-treatment years. When CMR ended in 2018 few treated frogs remained, and in 2021 surveys only a single adult was observed. 
This decline was likely due to both reduced adult survival and insufficient recruitment. 
Survival of treated adults, although higher than that for control frogs, was generally still lower than that of most persisting enzootic MYL frog populations [@joseph2018disease; @briggs2010enzootic]. <!--R2 wants preceding sentence to have comparative ranges of frog survival in LeConte vs persistent sites. My text reduction removed the values that had been presented for LeConte, which may lessen the need/desire to see two sets of values compared-->
The low recruitment of new adults in 2017 and 2018 despite large numbers of early life stages resembles recruitment levels we have observed in other enzootic *R. sierrae* populations, and is likely a consequence of high chytridiomycosis-caused mortality of frogs during and soon after metamorphosis [@joseph2018disease, and results from Barrett and Dusy treatments described above].
Whether this recruitment bottleneck was more severe in the LeConte population than in persistent enzootic MYL frog populations remains an important unanswered question. 

<!--transition needed-->

Two results from the adult treatment experiments complicate the interpretation of the overall treatment effect. 
First, at the beginning of the experiment, all frogs in the control group were captured and processed 1--3 days after all frogs in the treated group. 
Because Bd loads in the population were increasing during this period, Bd loads on control frogs were somewhat higher than those on treated frogs. 
This could have exaggerated the subsequent differences in survival between control and treated frogs.
Although we acknowledge this potential confounding effect, two factors suggest that the initial differences in Bd loads between control and treated frogs were not the primary cause of the lower survival of control frogs. 
First, pre-treatment Bd loads of control and treated frogs were very high, and given the relationship between Bd load and estimated survival in untreated control frogs (Figure 4c), survival of untreated frogs over the range of pre-treatment Bd loads observed in both groups would be expected to be near zero. 
<!--Second, for the range of Bd load values that overlapped between frogs in the control and treated groups, treated frogs had much higher survival than control frogs.--> <!--repeats statement from two paragraphs above-->
This, along with the apparently higher tolerance of Bd infection observed in treated versus control frogs, suggest that the higher survival of treated frogs compared to control frogs during the post-treatment period was primarily due to resistance and tolerance that followed treatment, and not the difference in pre-treatment Bd loads between control and treated frogs. 

The second complicating result is the unexpectedly large number of non-experimental frogs captured during the post-treatment period. 
In untreated MYL frog populations, Bd epizootics typically result in the mortality of all, or nearly all, adults within one year [@vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
Based on this, if the treatment increased frog survival, as predicted, then during the post-treatment period we would have captured primarily treated frogs, with control frogs and frogs that were not included in the experiment (i.e., untreated "non-experimental" frogs) being rare or absent. 
This outcome was observed in the upper basin, where during 2016-2018 we captured 81 treated, zero control, and eight non-experimental frogs. 
Although this same pattern was true in the lower basin for treated and control frogs (132 and 2 captured, respectively), we also captured 615 non-experimental frogs. 
Based on their sizes, most were older adults that had survived the epizootic, and the remainder were new recruits that had survived the epizootic as subadults or small adults. 
During the 2016-2018 period, frog-Bd dynamics in this non-experimental group were similar to those of the treated frogs, suggesting that these frogs had also mounted an effective adaptive immune response, and as a result, subsequently showed increased Bd resistance/tolerance and relatively high survival.

The mechanism underlying the unexpectedly high survival of the non-experimental frogs during the 2015 Bd epizootic is unknown. 
In theory, treatment of a large fraction of the adult population could have reduced the pathogen pressure experienced by untreated frogs and increased their survival  [@briggs2010enzootic]. 
However, this would have increased the survival of control and non-experimental frogs, but only non-experimental frogs were captured in large numbers. 
In addition, despite similar treatments conducted in both the upper and lower basins, we observed a large number of non-experimental frogs only in the lower basin. 

Another possible cause of unexpectedly high survival of non-experimental frogs, and only in the lower basin, could be the high habitat complexity that characterizes the lower basin. 

The upper basin contains a single lake and its associated inlet and outlet streams, but no adjacent ponds, meadows, or springs that provide suitable *R. sierrae* habitat.

As a result, the entire frog population is restricted to the site at which the epizootic occurred. 
In contrast, the lower basin contains a diverse array of aquatic habitats, including two lakes, four ponds, and associated streams, marshes, and springs, all of which were used by *R. sierrae* prior to the epizootic. 
Although conjectural, it is possible that frogs in some of these associated habitats experienced lower pathogen pressure, lower Bd loads, and higher survival during the epizootic than frogs in the much larger lake-dwelling populations. 

<!--better transition needed-->
<!--Inclusion of Treasure in main text is now purely discussion; I  moved all methods and results to the Supporting Information. So, is it adequately introduced and described here to not be confusing? -->

When we detected an epizootic in a *R. sierrae* population at Treasure Lake (Inyo National Forest, California, USA), we intended to replicate the LeConte treatment by treating adult frogs with the same antifungal protocol. 
Despite that objective, when the response team arrived on site, conditions in the population precluded a rigorous experiment with treated and controlled frogs; as such, the treatment, analysis, and results for this trial are described only in Supporting Information. 
The upshot of the Treasure treatment is that Bd load reduction paralleled that seen in LeConte, but differences between the trials and outcomes reveal insights that can guide future treatments (see Supporting Information). 
In Treasure, the reduction of Bd loads did not enhance frog survival as it had in LeConte: although the magnitude of load reductions was similar in both populations, and 48% of treated Treasure frogs were recaptured one month post-treatment, no treated frogs were detected at Treasure during the subsequent two summers (no frogs were detected). 
The small number of frogs treated and the lack of a control group preclude strong conclusions.
However, the way short-term outcomes were similar at both sites but diverged in the long-term suggests that the strong effects of treatment observed in the LeConte experiments are not universal. 
Success likely depends on the timing of the treatment relative to the onset of the epizootic (later in Treasure than LeConte) or the inherent susceptibility of the frog population to Bd infection [e.g., @savage2011mhc]. 
The juxtaposition of these results suggests that effective intervention would require managers' constant vigilance and rapid response to an epizootic, but also managers' willingness to recognize a narrow window of opportunity in which an intervention is an effective use of resources.

In summary, our adult treatment experiments altered frog-Bd dynamics in a predictable way, reducing Bd loads of treated versus control frogs and increasing frog survival. 
However, the duration of the effect on survival depended on at least the timing of the treatment relative to the development of the epizootic. Unlike the short-term effects resulting from the treatment of early life stages, effects on adults could be sustained over three-years post-treatment. 
This is consistent with adults having mounted an effective adaptive immune response against Bd infection. 
However, even when treatment increased adult survival, the high susceptibility of early life stages to chytridiomycosis [@bakar2016susceptibility; @grogan2018review] may limit recruitment, allow population declines due to senescence without replacement, and preclude long-term population persistence.

## Microbiome augmentation of subadult frogs {-}

Results from the treatment experiments described above indicate that the effectiveness of treatments in changing long-term frog-Bd dynamics and facilitating population persistence depends heavily on the survival of subadult frogs and their recruitment into the adult population under post-epizootic conditions. 
Given the low immunocompetence of subadults against Bd [@rollins1998metamorphosis; @grogan2018review], reducing Bd loads on subadults using itraconazole appears insufficient to keep loads low over the longer term and increase survival (see results of Barrett and Dusy treatments). 
The addition of protective probiotic bacteria to the frog skin microbiome may be a possible means to reduce susceptibility of this vulnerable life stage to chytridiomycosis and increase survival to adulthood [@rebollar2020amphibian; @harris2009skin; @bletz2013mitigating]. 
In this application, the effectiveness of probiotics will depend critically on the ability of the added bacteria to establish on frog skin and maintain sufficiently high densities over the months or years of the subadult-to-adult transition. 

The results from our microbiome augmentation experiment suggest that the addition of *J. lividum* to the frog skin microbiome following itraconazole treatment is insufficient to provide the long-term protection from Bd infection required to increase subadult survival. 
The relatively rapid decline of *J. lividum* concentrations on frogs in our study population suggests that the frog microbiome is resilient to changes in the species composition of symbiotic bacteria, and represents an important impediment to efforts to augment the microbiome with species that might confer increased protection from Bd [@kung2014stability]. 
In addition, for several weeks immediately following probiotic exposure when *J. lividum* concentrations were relatively high, Bd loads on *J. lividum*-treated subadults increased quickly and those of control and wild subadults appeared unaffected. 
Therefore, the predicted protective effect of *J. lividum* on subadults was not realized. 

However, an unexpected outcome of the microbiome augmentation experiment was the rapid spread of *J. lividum* from exposed subadults to control and wild subadults, and its apparent proliferation on the new hosts (*J. lividum* concentrations on control and wild frogs increased to concentrations similar to treated frogs). 
Whether *J. lividum* was transferred via direct frog-to-frog contact or through the water is unknown. 
In conclusion, although the colonization of frogs by *J. lividum* did not appear to confer increased Bd resistance, its spread from *J. lividum*-exposed to unexposed frogs indicates that if a probiotic with long-term effectiveness against Bd infection is ever identified, its introduction into a frog population may be relatively straight-forward.

## Conclusions {-}

<!--Our experiments indicate that treatment of early life stage and adult MYL frogs with antifungal agents during or immediately following epizootics strongly altered frog-Bd dynamics over the short term. 
However, in the long term, all six treatments failed to facilitate host population persistence in the presence of Bd.
Given this, recovery of MYL frogs will require other approaches that more effectively mitigate the impacts of Bd infection, in particular by increasing the survival and recruitment of early life stages. 
Mountain yellow-legged frog recovery efforts conducted during the past 15 years indicate the potential of frog translocations using animals collected from populations that have rebounded during the two or more decades following past Bd epizootics [@knapp2016large; @joseph2018disease]. 
Frogs in these populations may have genotypes that are more resistant to or tolerant of Bd infection than those in Bd-naive populations [@knapp2016large], providing an important advantage to translocated individuals.
Use of such populations as sources of frogs for translocations is not universally effective in allowing population re-establishment [@joseph2018disease; see also @brannelly2016chytrid], but results from more than 20 translocations of adult MYL frogs conducted to date indicate a high probability of success. 
Encouragingly, these translocated populations are typically characterized by stable, enzootic frog-Bd dynamics, low-to-moderate Bd loads across a wide range of frog densities, and annual survival exceeding 50% [e.g., @joseph2018disease].
Such translocations provide the best known opportunity to reestablish extirpated MYL frog populations across their historical range. 
Given possible evolution of increased resistance or tolerance in other amphibian species following exposure to Bd [@voyles2018shifts; @savage2016adaptive; @bataille2015susceptibility], similar efforts might be applicable to the recovery of other Bd-endangered amphibian species [e.g., @brannelly2016chytrid; @mendelson2019recovery]. -->

<!-- My paragraph below de-emphasizes translocation, which was a dangling concept introduced at the conclusion of the paper. If we want to emphasize translocation, it needs its own paragraph which is not the last paragraph in the paper -->
<!--This is approximately 100 words longer than what I removed-->

Our results demonstrate that in situ treatment of wild, early life stage and adult MYL frogs with antifungal agents during or immediately following epizootics can strongly reduce Bd loads on individuals over the short term. 
This is a critical step in mitigating an epizootic and facilitating a transition to enzootic host-pathogen dynamics [@drawert2017using]. 
However, in the long term, our three treatment strategies failed to facilitate host population persistence in the presence of Bd.
Given this, managed recovery (restoration) of MYL frogs will require alternative or combined approaches that simultaneously mitigate infections in all life stages and enhance the survival and recruitment of early life stages. 
Natural recovery of MYL frogs in the presence of Bd may also provide lessons and tools to improve restoration efforts. 
Mountain yellow-legged frog and disease research conducted during the past 15 years has revealed natural recovery of populations that rebounded over two or more decades following past Bd epizootics [@knapp2016large; @joseph2018disease]. 

Continued research into the mitigation of Bd epizootics, the transition to population persistence (host-pathogen coexistence), and the natural recovery of frogs in the presence of Bd can inform strategies to respond to Bd epizootics and other emerging wildlife diseases. 
For example, Bd-resistant/tolerant MYL frogs and persistent populations provide sustainable sources for translocations, which have been relatively successful at reestablishing disease-persistent MYL frog populations in sites where frogs were previously extirpated by disease [@joseph2018disease, @knapp2011nowhere]. 
Second, they demonstrate that variations within or among hosts, pathogens, or habitats can lead to alternate disease outcomes [@briggs2010enzootic].
MYL frogs in these populations may have genotypes or microbiomes that are more resistant to or tolerant of Bd infection than those in Bd-naive populations [@knapp2016large], or the habitats may be less suitable to Bd transmission [add a citation].
Other amphibian species have demonstrated potential evolution of increased resistance or tolerance following exposure to Bd [@voyles2018shifts; @savage2016adaptive; @bataille2015susceptibility].
Across amphibian hosts threatened by Bd, these variable disease outcomes may provide opportunities for natural recovery or managed restoration [e.g., @brannelly2016chytrid; @mendelson2019recovery]. 
Continuing to quantify - and learning how to alter - the amphibian-Bd host-pathogen relationship may be essential to maintaining many threatened species on the landscape.
As wildlife diseases emerge [@daszak2000emerging; @cunningham2017one], the lessons that we learn from observing host-pathogen dynamics may help slow declines of threatened wildlife species, mitigate wildlife-human disease spillover, and preserve both global biodiversity and public health [alexander2018ecology, @daszak2000emerging].
