# Abstract {-}

In this report, we describe the outcome of studies conducted primarily in Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Yosemite National Parks that attempted to mitigate the negative effects of the amphibian chytrid fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd) on populations of the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog (*Rana muscosa*, *Rana sierrae*). 
These studies included treatment of (1) tadpoles and subadults, and (2) adults with the antifungal drug itraconazole during Bd epizootics, and (3) augmentation of the skin microbiome of subadults with *Janthinobacterium lividum*, a commensal bacterium with antifungal properties. 
In field experiments focused on early life stages, Bd loads and frog survival returned to pre-treatment levels relatively quickly, and treatment had no effect on population persistence. 
In adults, itraconazole treatment reduced Bd loads over several years and increased survival. 
However, recruitment of new adults failed to occur and the population eventually declined to near-extirpation. 
In the microbiome augmentation experiment, bathing frogs in a *J. lividum* solution after Bd load reduction with itraconazole increased concentrations of this bacterium on frogs. However, concentrations declined relatively quickly, and any benefit of the joint Bd-clearing and *J. lividum* augmentation was lost before a clear effect on frog survival was realized. 
We conclude that Bd mitigation efforts focused on populations that are Bd-naive or post-epizootic are unlikely to be effective.
Instead, recovery efforts should utilize robust recovering populations whenever possible. 
Reintroduction of frogs from such populations provides the best opportunity to reestablish extirpated mountain yellow-legged frog populations across their historical range.

# Introduction {-}

Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly common in wildlife, often due to anthropogenic changes in the ecology of the host or pathogen [@daszak2000emerging; @cunningham2017one].
Impacts of disease on wildlife can be severe, including long-term population decline and even extinction, with far-reaching effects on species, communities, and ecosystems [@ostfeld2008infectious; @scheele2019amphibian].
Diseases of wildlife can also spill over to humans and domestic animals [@alexander2018ecology]. Collectively, these impacts of emerging wildlife diseases have significant consequences to global biodiversity and public health [@daszak2000emerging]. 
As such, the ability to control diseases in wildlife is critically important, but disease management is often difficult because wildlife diseases are relatively poorly described, many fewer intervention measures (e.g., vaccines) are available than for humans, and free ranging wildlife are inherently difficult to study and treat [@joseph2013taming]. As a result, available management strategies are mostly insufficient to mitigate the destructive effects of disease on wildlife.

The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis is caused by the chytrid fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (“Bd”). 
This recently discovered pathogen [@berger1998chytridiomycosis; @longcore1999batrachochytrium] is thought to have originated in Asia [@ohanlon2018recent] and spread globally via human commerce [@schloegel2009magnitude]. 
Bd is highly pathogenic to a wide range of amphibian taxa and, by one estimate, has caused the severe decline or extinction of at least 500 amphibian species [@scheele2019amphibian], with many more predicted to be at risk [@rodder2009global]. 
In an effort to reduce the impact of chytridiomycosis, several mitigation measures have been suggested as means to increase the fraction of frogs surviving chytridiomycosis outbreaks, including treating frogs with antifungal agents (using drugs or augmentation of the skin microbiome with probiotics), treating the environment with antifungals to reduce the pool of infectious zoospores, and reducing host population density [@garner2016mitigating]. 
Unfortunately, recent mathematical modeling suggests that none of these three types of mitigation measures are likely to be effective at preventing chytridiomycosis-induced population extirpation, but treating frogs had the greatest likelihood of a beneficial outcome [@drawert2017using]. 
Relatively few field tests of these treatment strategies have been conducted to date, but those that have show limited effectiveness in promoting host population persistence [@woodhams2012treatment; @garner2016mitigating].

Mountain yellow-legged (“MYL”) frogs are emblematic of global amphibian declines, including those caused by Bd. 
The mountain yellow-legged frog is a complex of two closely-related species, *Rana muscosa* and *Rana sierrae*, endemic to the mountains of California and adjacent Nevada, USA [@vredenburg2007concordant].
During the past century, MYL frogs have disappeared from more than 90% of their historical localities [@vredenburg2007concordant] and are listed as “endangered” under the U.S. Endangered Species Act [@usfws2002determination; @usfws2014endangered]. 
In the Sierra Nevada portion of their range, the primary causes of decline are the introduction of nonnative fish into naturally fishless lakes and streams and more recently, the spread of Bd [@knapp2000nonnative; @vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
MYL frogs are highly susceptible to chytridiomycosis.
Arrival of Bd in a naive population typically results in rapid increases in Bd prevalence and infection intensity ("load"), and subsequent mass frog die-offs [@vredenburg2010dynamics]. 
Such epizootics generally lead to the extirpation of the affected frog population, and hundreds of such extirpations have occurred in the past two decades as Bd spread across the Sierra Nevada. <!-- MJ: worth defining epizootic and enzootic? -->

We conducted a series of field trials of antifungal treatments applied to *R. sierrae* populations during or soon after epizootics, with a goal of reducing Bd load and increasing frog survival and population persistence. 
Trials included (1) treatment of early life stages (tadpoles and recently metamorphosed subadults) with the antifungal drug itraconazole [@garner2009using], (2) treatment of adults with itraconazole, and (3) manipulation of the frog skin microbiome by exposing subadult frogs to *Janthinobacterium lividum*, a symbiotic bacterium on amphibian skin that has antifungal properties [@brucker2008amphibian]. 
All study populations were Bd-naive in the years prior to the Bd epizootic and subsequent treatment, based on multiple years of skin swab collection [e.g., @vredenburg2010dynamics]. 

The first itraconazole treatments were conducted in 2009 and 2010, and focused on early life stages. 
These two experiments were motivated by contemporaneous empirical and modeling results that suggested that reducing Bd transmission rates by treating a large proportion of a frog population could increase host survivorship and facilitate a transition from epizootic to enzootic Bd dynamics [@vredenburg2010dynamics; @briggs2010enzootic]. 
<!-- MJ: I think we could add some detail here to make a stronger connection between the briggs 2010 pnas paper and the focus on early life stages here. e.g., is there something worth mentioning here about the zoospore pool, or trying to target a large fraction of the population that would point to treatments focused on non-adult life stages? -->
Early life stages of amphibians have immune systems that appear relatively ineffective against Bd [@rollins1998metamorphosis; @grogan2018review], but adults of at least some species, including MYL frogs, can develop adaptive immune defenses that may be partially protective [@ellison2015more; @grogan2018evolution; @knapp2016large]. 

In adults, antifungal treatments could work in parallel with adaptive immunity to increase survival during epizootics and facilitate the transition of affected populations to an enzootic state. 
Under this scenario, the high mortality observed in MYL frogs during Bd epizootics could be the result of rapid increases in Bd loads on frogs causing severe chytridiomycosis and subsequent mortality before adaptive immune defenses are fully developed. 
If true, treating adult frogs with antifungal drugs during an epizootic could slow the growth of Bd and allow the full development of adaptive immunity, which in turn could increase adult survival and population persistence. To test this possibility, we conducted antifungal treatments of adult frogs in 2015 and 2018. 

The itraconazole treatments used in the previously-described experiments are one-time manipulations, and as such, their ability to increase frog population persistence depends on this pulse perturbation causing long-lasting changes in frog-Bd dynamics. 
In contrast, a press perturbation that, by definition, is sustained over a longer time period, may have a higher probability of producing long-lasting changes in frog-Bd dynamics. 
One such press perturbation is the manipulation of the amphibian skin microbiome to shift the ambient microbial community to an alternative stable configuration that has stronger antifungal properties [@woodhams2014interacting; @bletz2013mitigating]. 
The feasibility of such a manipulation is suggested by laboratory experiments in which augmentation of the skin microbiome with antifungal bacteria altered frog-Bd dynamics and increased frog survival [@harris2009skin; @kueneman2016probiotic; but see also @becker2011towards]. 
In 2012, we tested this possibility in the wild with an experiment on subadult frogs. 

All five antifungal treatments changed frog-Bd dynamics, and most increased frog survival. 
However, they failed to accomplish the ultimate objective of increasing the probability of frog population persistence, and all populations declined to extirpation or near-extirpation during the study periods. 
Nevertheless, the detailed results from multiple treatments across different life stages is unusual, and collectively allow important insights into the reasons for the failure of treatments to influence population persistence. 
These insights are essential for the future development of mitigation measures that accomplish this important objective in the face of one of the most devastating wildlife diseases in recorded history [@scheele2019amphibian].

# Methods {-}

This section is divided into general methods that apply to all or most of the treatments, followed by a description of specific methods related to each treatment. 

## General methods {-}

### Visual encounter surveys {-}

Counts of *R. sierrae* life stages (adults: $\geq$ 40 mm snout-vent length (SVL); subadults: < 40 mm; tadpoles) were made during diurnal visual encounter surveys (VES) of the entire water body shoreline and the first 100 m of inlet and outlet streams. 
Additional details are provided in @knapp2000nonnative.

### Capture-mark-recapture surveys {-}

To allow estimation of adult survival, we used capture-mark-recapture (CMR) surveys [@joseph2018disease]. 
During each summer, the study lakes were re-visited one to three times (i.e., primary periods), and during each primary period all frog populations were generally surveyed on either one day or on three consecutive days. 
During each daily survey, any adult frogs observed were captured, identified via their passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag (or tagged if untagged), and released. 
When captured for the first time during a primary period, frogs were also swabbed (see next section for details), measured, and weighed. 

### Quantifying Bd load using skin swabs {-}

We quantified Bd load using standard swabbing and quantitative PCR methods [@boyle2004rapid; @hyatt2007diagnostic; see @vredenburg2010dynamics for swabbing methods specific to MYL frogs]. 
We defined Bd load as the number of ITS1 copies per swab [see @joseph2018disease for details]. 
For reference to figures provided in the Results, in post-metamorphic *R. sierrae*, Bd loads indicative of severe chytridiomycosis are $\geq$ 600,000 ITS copies [= 5.8 ITS copies on a log~10~ scale; @vredenburg2010dynamics; @joseph2018disease].

### Itraconazole treatment {-}

In each of the antifungal treatments, animals (adults, subadults, or tadpoles, depending on the treatment) were captured from the study lakes using hand-held nets. 
Immediately following capture, a skin swab sample was collected from all animals or a subset (depending on the treatment) to describe Bd load. Adults and subadults were measured and weighed, and adults were tagged using 8 mm PIT tags inserted under the dorsal skin via a small incision. 

Animals assigned to the "treated" group were held in large mesh pens (2 m $\times$ 2 m $\times$ 0.75 m) for the duration of the multi-day treatment period. 
Pens were anchored in the littoral zone of the study lakes, and contained shallow water and shoreline habitats for basking and deeper water habitat (up to 0.7 m) that frogs and tadpoles use at night (Figure S1). 
After swabbing, animals assigned to the untreated "control" group were held in pens only 3-24 hr and then released back into the lake. 
Although it would have been ideal to hold animals from both the treated and control groups in pens for the duration of the treatment period, doing so could have produced spurious results. 
Bd transmission is expected to increase with frog density [@rachowicz2007quantifying], and holding untreated control animals in pens at relatively high density could therefore have increased their Bd loads and reduced survival more than would be expected for animals in the treated category that were given daily antifungal baths. 
This would have biased the outcome toward higher survival of treated compared to control animals even if the antifungal treatment itself had no effect on survival. 
Assuming that holding animals in pens for several days has some negative effect (due to increased Bd transmission even in treated frogs, and lack of feeding opportunities), if our study design caused biases they should be conservative, i.e., reducing the survival of treated animals relative to control animals.

To conduct the antifungal treatments, on each day during the treatment period all animals in the treated category were removed from pens and placed into small plastic tubs that contained a dilute solution [1.5 mg L^‑1^; @garner2009using] of the antifungal drug itraconazole (trade name = Sporonox). 
The volume of itraconazole solution varied between 2 and 5 L and allowed all life stages to submerge fully. 
Frogs were treated in batches of approximately 50, and tadpoles in batches of approximately 100. 
After 10 minutes, animals were removed from the tubs and returned to pens. 
To determine treatment effectiveness, all animals or a subset (depending on the experiment) were re-swabbed at the end of the treatment period. 
<!-- consider "after the last treatment on the final day" instead of "at the end of the treatment period" to disambiguate w/ "after treatment every day" -->

After the final treatment, all animals were released from the pens back into the study lakes.

### Statistical analyses {-} 

We analyzed treatment results with linear simple and multilevel models in a Bayesian framework. 
All analyses except one used the *brms* package in R [@bürkner2017rpackage; @bürkner2018advanced; @rsoftware2020]. 
The exception was the analysis of the CMR data collected as part of the itraconazole treatment in LeConte Basin. 
The LeConte CMR model was implemented in Stan [@carpenter2017stan] directly instead of via the *brms* interface. 
When using the *brms* package, our analysis workflow included starting with a model that included all relevant population-level ("fixed") effects and their interactions, and checking model fit using visualizations of leave-one-out ("LOO") probability integral transformations [@gelman2013bayesian; @vehtari2017practical]. 
When suggested by the data structure or measures of model fit, we evaluated other model families or added group-level ("random") effects to the model. 
In addition, when necessary, we developed distributional models in which predictor terms are specified for other parameters of the response distribution instead of only the mean (e.g., negative binomial overdispersion ("shape"), zero-inflation ("zi"); see *brms* vignette, "Estimating distributional models with brms": https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_distreg.html). 
<!-- Consider changing "shape" to "overdispersion" throughout the manuscript & tables -->
Briefly, the overdispersion parameter $\phi$ controls the variance of the negative binomial distribution relative to the expected value $\mu$, such that the variance of the negative binomial distribution is $\mu + \mu^2 / \phi$. 
For example, itraconazole treatment can reduce not only mean Bd load, but also the variation around the mean (i.e, shape) and amount of zero-inflation. 
In these situations, including predictor terms for the mean, shape, and zi parameters can be helpful in improving model fit (additive effects only). 
We compared fits of models using LOO cross-validation and the *loo* package [@vehtari2017practical]. 
For all models, we used *brms* defaults for priors, number of chains (4), and warmup and post-warmup iterations (1000 for each). We evaluated the adequacy of posterior samples using trace plots, Gelman-Rubin statistics (Rhat), and measures of effective sample size ("bulk-ESS", "tail-ESS"). 

The models described below are the best-fit models that resulted from the workflow outlined above.
We considered predictors of group- and population-level effects and family-specific parameters to be important when the 95% credible interval ("CI") of the estimates did not include zero, and relatively unimportant otherwise. 
We provide the results of all analyses in tabular form, either in the Results section for analyses describing the outcome of treatment experiments, or in Supporting Information for related but less central analyses. 
The key results from treatment experiments are also visualized using boxplots or dotplots. 
We used the former when sample sizes were relatively large and the latter when sample sizes were small and boxplots were consequently less informative. 
When relevant, sample sizes are displayed above the x-axis of each plot. 
In plots where sample sizes are displayed, the lack of sample size information for a particular group indicates that this group was intentionally not included in surveys and/or sampling. 
In contrast, a sample size of zero ("n=0") indicates that this group was included in surveys and/or sampling, but that no individuals were available for capture and sampling. 

## Experiment-specific methods {-}

### Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

Bd-caused epizootics and resulting mass die-offs of *R. sierrae* occurred in Barrett Lakes Basin during 2005 to 2007 [@vredenburg2010dynamics] and in Dusy Basin in 2009 [@jani2017epidemic]. 
In an effort to prevent the extirpation of remnant populations, itraconazole treatments were conducted over seven consecutive days during mid-summer of 2009 in Barrett and 2010 in Dusy. 
Because adults typically succumb to chytridiomycosis early in an epizootic [@vredenburg2010dynamics], at the time of the experiments these populations contained primarily late-stage tadpoles, recently metamorphosed subadults, and occasionally a small number of residual adults. 
We used results from basin-wide VES conducted prior to the experiments to identify the largest remaining tadpole populations, and these were selected for use in the experiments. 
Populations in both basins were assigned to treated and control groups at random. 
The Barrett experiment included three treated and three control populations, and in Dusy, where fewer frog populations existed, a total of three treated and two control populations were used (Table S1). 
For both experiments, we predicted that itraconazole treatment would reduce Bd loads and increase the survival of animals during metamorphosis. In turn, this would result in more subadults counted during VES conducted in treated versus control populations in the year of and the year following treatment. 
In both basins, we estimate that we captured and treated 70-90% of the early life-stage animals present based on VES.  

In the Barrett experiment, on July 29 pens were set up in the ponds assigned to the treated group. 
During July 29 to August 1, as many *R. sierrae* as possible (mostly tadpoles) were captured from each pond and added to the pens. Swabs were collected from a subset of animals to quantify Bd load.
Daily itraconazole treatments were conducted during the period July 30 -- August 5, and animals were treated from four to seven times, depending on the day of capture. 
To assess treatment effectiveness in reducing Bd loads, swabs were collected from a subset of animals following the final treatment. 
A total of 977 tadpoles and 65 subadults were treated and released back into the study ponds. 
In the control populations, animals were captured on a single day (one population per day during August 2--4), swabbed, held in a pen until capturing was complete, and then released. 
Swabs were collected from a total of 75 tadpoles and 23 subadults. 
To quantify the longer-term effects of treatment on Bd load and frog population dynamics, we conducted post-treatment VES and swabbing at each pond monthly in August and September 2009, and in July, August, and September 2010. 

The Dusy experiment was identical in most respects to the Barrett experiment. During July 24--26, we captured as many animals as possible from the ponds assigned to the treated group and placed them in pens. 
Daily itraconazole treatments began on July 27 and lasted through August 2, resulting in seven days of treatment for all animals. 
Swabs were collected from a subset of animals from the ponds assigned to the treated group on July 27 before treatment began, and after the final treatment on August 2. 
A total of 3707 tadpoles and 125 subadults were treated. 
Animals in control populations were captured, swabbed, and released on July 29 (62 tadpoles and 18 subadults). 
We conducted follow-up VES in each pond monthly in August and September 2010, and July and August 2011.

Our analysis of the data from the experiments focused on two questions: During the one-year period following the treatments, did itraconazole treatment influence (1) Bd loads and (2) survival of treated animals? 
<!-- I'm changing the wording a bit here to better match descriptions in subsequent paragraph topic sentences -->
To address the first question, we developed separate models to estimate (i) pre-treatment differences in Bd loads of the animals assigned to the treated and control groups, (ii) immediate effects of treatment on Bd loads, and (iii) treatment effects on post-release Bd loads in the year of treatment and the following year. Because the treatments in Barrett and Dusy Basins were virtually identical in their design, we combined the results from both experiments into a single dataset, and included basin as a predictor variable in models to account for any between-basin differences.

<!-- Do we want to refer to Bd load as `load` instead of `bd_load` in our models? -->
<!-- Consider using "treatment-by-basin" instead of "(treatment x basin)" -->
We evaluated pre-treatment differences in Bd load between treated and control groups using the model *bd_load ~ (treatment x basin)* (family = negative binomial, treatment = treated/control, basin = Barrett/Dusy). 
Life stage (tadpole, subadult) was not included in the model as a predictor because some ponds contained mostly tadpoles but a few contained mostly subadults, introducing the potential for singular model fits. 
<!-- This "singular" model fit thing might irk reviewers - not clear what a singular fit is from a Bayesian perspective. I might be missing something here though, but I'd expect that we wouldn't run into "singular" fit issues. Maybe a better explanation is that life stage and basin were collinear, such that we could not estimate their separate effets.  -->
Adding a group-level effect of site_id did not improve model fit, indicating that between-pond differences due to the life stages present were unimportant.  

The immediate effect of treatment on Bd load was assessed using the model *bd_load ~ stage + (treat_category x basin)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, treat_category = beginning/end of treatment period). 
We were able to include stage in this model because many tadpoles metamorphosed into subadults during the treatment, producing a more balanced representation of stages across sites. 
Plots of conditional effects suggested substantial differences in Bd load variation between stages, treatment categories, and basins. 
Therefore, the shape parameter was modeled as a function of all three predictor variables. 

The effect of treatment on post-release Bd loads was evaluated using the model *bd_load ~ stage + basin + (year_std x treatment) + (1 | site_id)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, year_std is a dummy variable in which 0 = year of treatment and 1 = year after treatment, site_id included as a group-level effect). 
Plots of conditional effects suggested substantial differences in Bd load variation between stages, basins, years, and treatment groups, and therefore the shape parameter was modeled as a function of all four predictor variables. 

The effect of treatment on subsequent subadult counts was assessed using the model *count ~ basin + tadpole + (std_year x treatment) + (1 | site_id)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, subadult = number of subadults counted during a VES, tadpole = number of tadpoles counted during the same VES - log~10~ transformed, site_id included as a group-level effect). The count of subadults served as a proxy for subadult survival, which could not be estimated directly. To account for differences between ponds in potential subadult production due to differences in the number of tadpoles (= future subadults), we included the tadpole count variable. 

*Effect of treatment on the zoospore pool*. During the itraconazole treatments in Dusy Basin in 2010, we tested if treatment of frogs reduced the concentration of Bd zoospores in the ponds ["zoospore pool"; @briggs2010enzootic]. 
We sampled the zoospore pool before and after itraconazole treatments (July 23-25 and August 21-24, respectively), in each of the five ponds included in the experiment (Table 1).
Water samples (six per pond) were collected by filtering water until filters clogged. 
Bd loads on filters were quantified by analyzing three replicate subsamples using qPCR. 
Additional details of the methods used are provided in Supporting Information. 
The effect of frog treatments on Bd concentrations on filters was evaluated using the model *bd_load ~ (pre_post x treatment) + (1 | sample_id)* (family = negative binomial, pre-post = before/after the frog treatment period, sample_id included as a group-level effect to account for replicates). 

### Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

*LeConte Basin*. In mid-summer 2015, routine disease surveillance at one of the largest remaining Bd-naïve *R. sierrae* populations detected high Bd loads and the presence of many moribund and dead frogs. 
In response to this epizootic, we immediately conducted two antifungal treatment experiments, one in the lower portion of the basin and one in the upper portion (Table S1). 
The lower basin contains two lakes and four smaller ponds, and the upper basin contains a single lake. 
At the time of the experiments, all of these water bodies were occupied by *R. sierrae*. The two basins are approximately 750 m apart and are linked by streams and relatively gentle terrain; we therefore expected some movement of frogs between them.

The design of the treatment experiments in the lower and upper basins was nearly identical, differing only in the number of days spent capturing frogs for the “treated” group (three versus two days, respectively; Table S2). 
To simplify logistics, frogs in the treated group were captured during the first 2-3 days of the experiment, and frogs for the untreated (“control”) group were captured on the following day (day 3 or 4). 
All frogs included in the study were adults, and were collected opportunistically. 
Frogs that were visibly sick (as indicated by an impaired righting reflex) were excluded because these frogs were likely within hours of death. 
In the lower basin, a total of 360 and 102 frogs were captured for the treated and control groups, respectively. 
In the upper basin, these totals were 206 and 74 frogs. 
To meet our goal of completing frog capture and processing as quickly as possible (to minimize the introduction of additional confounding effects into the experiments), the number of adult frogs included in each experiment likely represented a relatively small proportion of those present. 

For each frog in the treated category, immediately following capture frogs were swabbed, tagged, measured, weighed, and released into pens. 
Control frogs were captured, processed, and released (see General Methods and Table S2 for details). 
Itraconazole treatments were conducted as described in General Methods and Table S2. 
To determine treatment effectiveness, 93 frogs in the lower basin treated group (31 from each capture date) and 50 frogs in the upper basin treated group (25 from each capture date) were re-swabbed on the day prior to the last treatment. 
After the last treatment, all frogs were released from the pens into the lake. 

To estimate pre-treatment differences in Bd loads of frogs assigned to the treated and control groups, we used the model *bd_load ~ (location x group)* (family = negative binomial, location = upper/lower, group = treated/control). 
To evaluate the immediate effect of treatment on Bd loads, we used the model *bd_load ~ (location x trt_period)* (family = negative binomial, trt_period = beginning/end of treatment period). 
For both analyses, we excluded any frogs that died during the treatment period. 
We evaluated differences in Bd loads of frogs that lived versus died using the model *trt_died ~ (lbd_load x location)* (family = bernoulli, lbdload = log~10~(bd_load + 1)).

The outcome of the treatment experiments was quantified using CMR surveys conducted during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018 (see General Methods for details). 
No post-treatment surveys were possible in 2015 because the frog active season was nearly over by the time the treatments were completed. 
There were 1-3 primary periods per summer, and except the final period in 2018 when only a one-day survey was conducted, all frog populations were surveyed on each of three consecutive days. 
Any untagged frogs captured during the surveys (i.e., frogs that were not part of the initial treatment phase of the experiment; “non-experimental”) were tagged and processed as described above.

We used open population multi-state hidden Markov models to understand subsequent population dynamics including survival and recruitment, while accounting for imperfect detection. 
We estimated population size over time using parameter-expanded Bayesian data augmentation, which augments the capture histories of observed individuals with a large number of capture histories for individuals that were never detected [@royle2012parameter].
The states included (1) “not recruited”, (2) “alive at the upper site”, (3) “alive at the lower site”, and (4) “dead”. 
On any particular survey, we considered three possible observations of an individual: (1) “alive at the upper site”, (2) “alive at the lower site”, and (3) “not detected”. 
The model structure builds on the work of Joseph and Knapp (2018), tracking individual Bd loads over time, allowing the expected Bd load (log~10~(Bd load + 1)) to vary as a function of treatment and time, and allowing the effect of Bd load on survival to vary as a function of treatment. 
Details of this model are provided in Supporting Information.

*Treasure Lakes Basin*. In July 2018, we conducted an antifungal treatment of adult *R. sierrae* during a Bd epizootic in the Treasure Lakes basin, Inyo National Forest (Table 1). 
Epizootics occurred in all other populations in the basin during summer 2017, and in 2018 the epizootic was occurring in the lake containing the last known adult frogs in the basin.
The 2018 epizootic provided another opportunity to conduct an itraconazole treatment in an effort to increase the survival of adult frogs. 
However, unlike the LeConte treatment described above, this treatment was conducted as a management action instead of an experiment, primarily due to the advanced stage of the epizootic and the resulting small number of adults remaining in the population. 
In the VES conducted just prior to the treatment period we found only 12 adult *R. sierrae*, and captured only 28 frogs during the first day of frog collection (12 person-hours). 
Dividing this small population into treated and untreated control groups would have provided little statistical power to detect between-group differences given low anticipated post-treatment recapture rates. 
In addition, fewer frogs would have received antifungal treatment. 
The lack of an experimental design limits the generality of our findings, but the treatment is nonetheless included here because of the additional insights the results provide. 

We used the same methods as described for the LeConte treatments, with two important differences: (1) all frogs were treated (there was no control group), and (2) new frogs were captured from the lake and added to the pens during the first five days of the 7-day treatment period. 
We treated 28 frogs on July 16, then added and treated an additional 24, 7, 7, 4, and 4 frogs on July 17 through 21, respectively. 
Although we captured and treated a total of 74 frogs, we released only 33 live frogs at the end of the treatment due to chytridiomycosis-caused mortality throughout the treatment period.
<!-- It's not clear to me how this model is different from the next -->
We re-swabbed each surviving frog the final itraconazole treatment, and assessed treatment effectiveness using the model *bd_load ~ treatcat* (family = negative binomial). 
We conducted follow-up VES, swabbing, and CMR surveys one month after the treatment (August 21-23) and again one year later (August 21-23, 2019).  

The greater range of treatment days to which frogs were exposed (compared to the LeConte treatments) provided an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of itraconazole treatment on Bd loads as a function of the number of daily treatments frogs received.
We calculated treatment effectiveness for individual frogs as the negative log ratio of pre-treatment Bd loads to post-treatment Bd loads (hereafter, "LRR"): -log~10~((load~pre~ + 1)/(load~post~ + 1). 
Samples of pre-treatment load were collected just prior to the first treatment a frog received, and samples of post-treatment load were collected from all treated frogs following the final treatment (just before frogs were released back into the lake). 
A negative LRR value indicates a reduction in Bd load, and a larger absolute value indicates a larger reduction. 
To evaluate the factors influencing treatment effectiveness, we used the model *LRR ~ (capture_bdload_std x days_inside)* (family = gaussian, capture_bdload_std = Bd load prior to treatment standardized to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1, days_inside = number of treatments a frog received). 

### Microbiome augmentation of subadult frogs {-}

In 2012, the Bd epizootic in Dusy Basin (see "Methods - Itraconazole treatment of early life stages") was ongoing and most *R. sierrae* populations were extirpated. 
Extant populations contained only late-stage tadpoles and recently metamorphosed subadults, and given the absence of any adults, were presumed to be the final cohorts at these sites. 
In July 2012, we initiated an experiment to test the combined effect of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* augmentation on Bd load and frog survival. 
This experiment was conducted at a single pond where late-stage tadpoles and recently-metamorphosed subadults were still relatively abundant. 
This pond was also used in the 2010 experiment in which early life stages were treated with itraconazole (Table 1). 

In designing this experiment, we assumed that probiotic bacteria would affect Bd-frog dynamics by reducing Bd colonization of relatively lightly infected frogs, instead of by reducing Bd load on heavily infected frogs (R. Harris, personal communication). 
Therefore, prior to exposing frogs to *J. lividum*, we first reduced their Bd loads with a 7-day itraconazole treatment. 
The experiment focused solely on subadults, and included a treated group (itraconazole treatment followed by *J. lividum* exposure) and a control group (no itraconazole, no *J. lividum*). 
We did not test independent or interactive effects of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* augmentation, a decision prompted by results from our previous experiments with early life stages showing a lack of longer-term benefits of itraconazole treatment alone (see Results) and the limited number of subadults available at the study pond. 
Subadults were captured on July 12-13 (n = 331) and assigned at random to treated and control groups at a ratio of approximately 80:20 (271 treated, 60 control). 
This ratio was chosen to maximize the number of subadults receiving antifungal treatment, and therefore the potential benefit to the population. 
All animals were given group-specific toe-clips as follows: (i) control = toe 2 on left front foot, and (ii) itraconazole + *J. lividum* = toe 2 on right front foot. 
We used toe clips because other tagging methods (e.g., visual implant elastomer, VI Alpha tags: Northwest Marine Technology) were not sufficiently visible through the dark skin of subadults. 
Following processing, subadults in the treated and control groups were held in separate mesh pens. 
To determine Bd loads prior to the start of the itraconazole treatment period, a subset of subadults from both groups were swabbed on July 12, and all control animals were released back into the study pond on July 13. 
Itraconazole treatments were conducted daily on July 12-18. 
The number of animals in each group declined somewhat during this period due to Bd-caused mortality and occasional predation by gartersnakes. 
To assess the effectiveness of itraconazole treatment in reducing Bd loads over the 7-day treatment period and to quantify the amount of *J. lividum* present naturally on subadults in this population, we swabbed a subset of animals on July 19 immediately prior to *J. lividum* exposure. 
To compare Bd loads on frogs assigned to the treated and control groups immediately before the treatment period, we used the model *bd_load ~ expt_trt* (family = negative binomial, expt_trt ). 
<!-- "expt_trt" is hanging at the end of the above sentence -->
The effectiveness of the itraconazole treatment was assessed with the model *bd_load ~ days* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial, days = -7 (before) versus 0 (after)). 

*J. lividum* for use in the experiment was obtained from the skin of an adult *R. sierrae* in Dusy Basin in 2009 and cultured using standard methods [@harris2009skin]. 
On July 19-20, we bathed the itraconazole-treated subadults (n = 256) in a solution of *J. lividum* culture for 4-4.5 hours (75 and 150 mL of *J. lividum* culture per liter of lake water on July 19 and 20, respectively). 
At the conclusion of the second *J. lividum* bath, all animals were released back into the pond.

To assess the longer-term effects of the combined itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment, we surveyed the study population during the summers of 2012 (n = 3 surveys), 2013 (n = 3), 2014 (n = 1), and 2019 (n = 1). 
During each of these surveys, we conducted VES and captured and swabbed as many subadult frogs as possible (no adults were captured), and recorded the toe-clip status for each individual. 
The concentration *J. lividum* on frogs was assessed from skin swabs using qPCR (see Supporting Information for details). 

We analyzed the collected data to address determine whether animals exposed to the combined itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment had (1) higher concentrations of *J. lividum* and lower Bd loads than untreated control animals and non-experimental ("wild") animals, and (2) higher survival than control animals. 
Analyses focused particularly on data collected during the summer of the treatment. 
For question 2, we used the percent of animals in each group that were recaptured as a proxy for survival. 
Unfortunately, recaptures of control animals quickly declined to near zero, thereby precluding formal comparisons of *J. lividum* and Bd load in the treated versus control group.
We were able to compare treated versus wild frogs, but importantly, unlike the treated and control groups that each contained a single cohort of toe-clipped animals that was repeatedly sampled over time, membership of animals in the wild group likely changed over time as new individuals metamorphosed and previously-metamorphosed individuals died.

<!-- Consider using jliv instead of jliv_ge (or explain what ge is?) -->
During the two month period following *J. lividum* exposure, we described the *J.lividum* concentration on treated versus wild frogs using the model *jliv_ge ~ (days x group)* (family = negative binomial, days = days since *J. lividum* exposure, group = treated/wild). 
Similarly, to describe Bd loads of treated versus wild frogs, we used the model *bd_load ~ (days x group)* (family = zero-inflated negative binomial). 
Formal assessment of the effect of treatment on survival was also not possible due to the rapid disappearance of animals in the control group, so the results are described graphically only. 

# Results {-}

## Itraconazole treatment of early life stages {-}

In the Barrett and Dusy experiments, immediately before itraconazole treatments began, Bd loads of animals in ponds assigned to the treated and control groups were similar (Figure 1a: Days = "-1 to 5"; Figure 1b: Days = "0-2"). 
Model results (Table S3) confirmed that Bd load did not differ between treatment groups. In addition, basin had a weak effect (loads were lower in Dusy than Barrett), and the (treatment x basin) interaction term was unimportant, indicating that the patterns of Bd load between treatment groups were similar in both basins. 

The treatments substantially reduced Bd loads of treated frogs (Figure 1a: Days = "-1 to 5" versus "6", Figure 1b: Days = "0-2" versus "6"). 
Model results (Table S4) substantiated the important effect of treatment period ("treatcat"; lower after treatment than before treatment). 
In addition, important effects on Bd load were also evident for frog stage (lower in tadpoles than subadults), basin (higher in Dusy than Barrett), and the (basin x treatment_category) interaction term. 
The importance of the interaction term indicated that loads were higher in Dusy than Barrett at the beginning of the treatment, but lower in Dusy than Barrett at the end of treatment (Figure 1). 
Finally, treatment category, stage, and basin all had important effects on the shape parameter. 

After release of the treated animals back into the study ponds, the reduction in Bd load in treated versus control groups that was evident at the end of the treatment period persisted for at least the next 1.5 months (Figure 1: Days > 6). 
Results from a model of predictors of Bd load over the 1-year post-release period (Table 1) showed important effects on Bd load of most predictor variables, including treatment (treated lower than control), stage (lower in tadpoles than subadults), year (lower in the year following treatment (year 1) than the year of treatment (year 0)), and the (year x treatment) interaction term. 
Basin did not have an important effect. 
The (year x treatment) term indicated that Bd loads were lower in the treated group than the control group in year 0, but by year 1 loads in the treated group had increased such that Bd loads of the treated and control groups were similar. 
Therefore, although the treatment effect was evident for more than a month, Bd loads on animals in treated ponds returned to pre-treatment levels in the year following treatment (Figure 1). 
All predictors of the shape parameter had important effects. 

The reduction in Bd load caused by the treatment was associated with increased counts of subadults in treated versus control populations (Figure 2).
Model results (Table 2) indicated that treatment and the (year x treatment) interaction term had important effects. 
The effects of tadpole count, basin, and year were unimportant. 
The interaction term indicated that treated populations had higher subadult counts than control populations in the year of the treatment, but that counts in treated populations in the year following treatment were low and similar to those in control populations (Figure 2). 
Therefore, mirroring the longer-term effects of treatment on Bd load, the increase in subadult counts in treated populations in the 1.5 months following treatment was no longer evident in the year following treatment. 

*Effect of treatment on zoospore pool*. Before treatment, zoospore pools (measured as Bd load of collected filters) in the ponds assigned to the control and treated groups were similar. After treatment, zoospore pools in control ponds may have increased slightly and remained relatively constant in treated ponds (Figure 3). 
However, estimated effects of treatment, basin, and the (treatment x basin) interaction term were all unimportant (Table S5). 
Therefore, assuming that the sampling method was adequate to accurately quantify pond-wide zoospore concentrations, the treatment of even a relatively large fraction of the resident *R. sierrae* in the study ponds did not measurably alter the zoospore pools. 
<!-- "assuming that the sampling method was adequate to accurately quantify pond-wide zoospore concentrations" might belong in the discussion -->

## Itraconazole treatment of adults {-}

### LeConte Basin {-}

In the two itraconazole treatment experiments conducted in LeConte Basin, prior to the treatment period, adult *R. sierrae* assigned to the treated and control groups had very high Bd loads, above the level at which symptoms of severe chytridiomycosis are evident (Figure 4). 
Bd loads in the control group were somewhat higher than in the treated group (Figure 4), likely because control frogs were captured and processed 1-3 days later than frogs assigned to the treated group (Table S2) and during a period of increasing Bd loads in the study populations. 
Model results (Table S6) affirmed an important pre-treatment difference in Bd load between treatment groups (treated groups lower than control groups).
Location and the (treatment x basin) interaction term were both unimportant, with the latter indicating that the pattern of Bd load between treatment groups was similar in both basins. 

Samples collected one day prior to the end of the 8-9 day treatment period (Table S2) indicated that in both experiments the treatment reduced Bd loads on treated frogs by 1.4-2.7 orders of magnitude (Figure 4). 
Model results (Table S7) corroborated the important effect of treatment on Bd load. 
<!-- Consider "location-by-period" instead of "(location * trt_period)" -->
The effect of location was also important (trt_period; higher in the upper than lower basin), as was the (location * trt_period) interaction term, with the latter indicating that Bd loads before and at the end of treatment were both higher in the upper than lower basin. 

During the treatment period, 74 of the lower basin treated frogs and 80 of the upper basin treated frogs died. 
All control frogs survived during the several hour period between capture, processing, and release.
Of the treated frogs that died, most did so during the first half of the treatment period (lower basin: 73%; upper basin: 74%), consistent with frogs succumbing to chytridiomycosis. 
However, Bd load was not an important predictor of whether frogs died versus survived (Table S8). 
Location and the (location x bd_load) interaction term were also unimportant.

```

During the three year post-treatment period across both experiments, 51% of treated frogs and 2% of control frogs were recaptured. 
In CMR surveys conducted during 2016-2018, a total of 2208 adult frogs were captured, representing 831 unique individuals. 
Between frog release in 2015 and the final survey in 2018, seven recaptured individuals moved between the two basins. 
All seven were in the treated group and had moved from the upper to the lower basin. 
These individuals were included in counts of unique individuals in the basin in which they were captured.
Of the 745 unique frogs captured in the lower basin, 132 were in the treated group, two were in the control group, and 611 were not part of the original treatment experiment (“non-experimental” frogs). 
These non-experimental frogs could have either survived the 2015 Bd epizootic as adults or recruited into the adult population after the epizootic. 
In the upper basin, of the 89 unique frogs captured, 81 were in the treated group and eight were non-experimental. 
No control frogs were captured. 
Based on CMR modeling, across the entire duration of the experiment (2015-2018), the 1212 individuals captured were estimated to represent approximately `r pct_observed$p[2]`% (posterior median) of the adults that existed in the LeConte population during this time (CI: `r pct_observed$p[1]`% -- `r pct_observed$p[3]`%). 

During the 2015 (post-treatment) to 2018 period, Bd loads on untreated control frogs were substantially higher than on treated and non-experimental frogs (posterior probability = 1). 
On average, loads of the control group were `r load_diff$diff[2]` (CI: `r load_diff$diff[1]` -- `r load_diff$diff[3]`) times higher than loads of the treated group (Figure 5a).
The two recaptured control frogs were recaptured in the year after the treatments (2016), and both had relatively low loads in 2015 relative to the rest of the individuals in the control group (Figure 5a). 
Bd load dynamics of the treated and non-experimental groups from 2016 to 2018 were similar. 
Importantly, the reduced loads of the treated group after the 2015 treatment period were maintained in subsequent years (Figure 5a). 

Overall, the LeConte adult population declined in abundance from 2015 to 2018, with the most rapid declines in the control group (Figure 5b). 
Between the end of the treatments in 2015 and the first surveys of 2016, the number of animals surviving in the control group dropped from 176 to `r ctrl_abund$med[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 2]` (CI: `r ctrl_abund$lo[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 2]` -- `r ctrl_abund$hi[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 2]`). 
By the end of the summer in 2016, the posterior median for the number of surviving control animals was `r ctrl_abund$med[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 4]` (CI: `r ctrl_abund$lo[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 4]` -- `r ctrl_abund$hi[ctrl_abund$primary_period == 4]`). 
Bd load had a stronger negative effect on survival in the control group relative to the treated and non-experimental groups (posterior probabilities = `r survival_diff$ctrl_lt_trt` and `r survival_diff$ctrl_lt_new`, for control versus treated, and control versus non-experimental, respectively; Figure 5C), consistent with control animals being less tolerant of Bd infection. 
Nonetheless, despite the treatment, by 2018 the study populations had declined to few remaining adults. 
In the last primary period of 2018, the posterior median for the number of treated frogs alive was `r trt_2018$med` (CI: `r trt_2018$lo` -- `r trt_2018$hi`), `r new_2018$med` for non-experimental frogs (CI: `r new_2018$lo` -- `r new_2018$hi`), and zero for controls (CI: 0 -- 0).

### Treasure Lakes Basin {-}

Similar to the situation in LeConte Basin, adult frog Bd loads were very high at Treasure Lake during early summer 2018, and at the start of the itraconazole treatment (Figure 6). 
Itraconazole treatment reduced Bd loads more than two orders of magnitude (Figure 6; Bd loads on 07-23 versus on days 07-16 to 07-21). 
Model results affirmed the important effect of treatment (Table S9). 

The number of itraconazole treatments a frog received ("days_inside") increased treatment effectiveness (Table S10). Initial Bd load ("capture_bdload_std") and the (days_inside x capture_bdload_std) interaction term were both unimportant (Table S10). 

Of the 33 frogs that were released back into the lake following treatment, 16 were recaptured in the CMR survey conducted one month later (Figure 7).
During the CMR survey, one non-experimental frog was also captured (Figure 7: treatment duration = "NA"). 
Bd loads of most recaptured frogs were low compared to those of frogs at the start and end of the treatment period (Figure 6, 7). 
There was no obvious relationship between the number of treatments a frog received and whether or not it was recaptured one month later (Figure 7). 
In surveys conducted in 2019 (the year following the treatment), we observed no *R. sierrae* of any life stage. 
Therefore, despite the substantial reduction in Bd loads caused by the 2018 treatment and the relatively large fraction of treated frogs recaptured one month later, few or none of the frogs survived overwinter until summer 2019. 

## Microbiome augmentation of subadult frogs {-}

In the Dusy Basin microbiome augmentation experiment, prior to the itraconazole treatment, Bd loads were similar in subadults assigned to the control and treated groups (Figure 8: days = -7).
Model results (Table S11) affirmed that pre-treatment Bd loads of the two groups were not different. 
Itraconazole treatment reduced Bd loads almost four orders of magnitude (Figure 8: day -7 versus 0), and model results (Table S12) substantiated this important effect. 

*J. lividum* exposure started on the day following the last day of itraconazole treatment, and on that day *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults assigned to the treated group were either zero or near-zero for all individuals (day 0; Figure 9). 
Twelve days after the two *J. lividum* baths to which animals in the treated group were subjected, *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults were high, but unexpectedly the concentrations were similarly high in treated, control, and wild groups instead of only in the treated group (day 0 versus 12; Figure 9).
This is consistent with transfer of *J. lividum* from treated animals to other frogs in the pond that had not been treated with itraconazole or bathed experimentally in high concentrations of *J. lividum*. 
However, over the following three months, *J. lividum* concentrations on subadults in all three groups declined to near baseline levels (Figure 9). 
Formal comparison of *J. lividum* concentrations from day 12 to day 56 across all three groups wasn't possible due to the almost complete loss of control frogs by day 37 (n = 1) and day 56 (n = 0). 
However, a model that included the treated and wild groups indicated an important negative effect of the number of days since *J. lividum* exposure on *J. lividum* concentration, but no effect of group or the (day x group) interaction term (Table 3). 
Therefore, *J. lividum* concentrations declined over the 2-month period and at similar rates in both treated and wild frogs. 

Following release of frogs in the treated group (itraconazole-treated and *J. lividum*-exposed) back into the study pond, their Bd loads increased steadily and reached pre-treatment levels after two months (Figure 8: day 56). 
Due to the rapid loss of frogs in the control group, formal comparison of Bd loads from day 12 to day 56 across all three groups wasn't possible. 
However, a model that included the treated and wild groups indicated that Bd loads increased from day 12 to day 56, and that Bd loads of wild frogs were higher than those of treated frogs (Table 4). 
In addition, there was an important effect of the (days x group) interaction term, due to increasing loads of treated frogs versus relatively constant loads of wild frogs. 
Together, these results indicate that the combined effect of itraconazole treatment and *J. lividum* exposure was ineffective in preventing the increase in Bd loads to pre-treatment levels. 
Increased concentrations of *J. lividum* on control and wild frogs also had no obvious effect on Bd load. 

During the three surveys of the study pond conducted in 2012, the percent of frogs in the treated and control groups that were recaptured declined, but the rate of decline was steeper in the control versus treated group (Figure 10). 
Although no formal analysis is possible due to the relatively few sample points, the results suggest that the itraconazole-*J. lividum* treatment increased frog survival over the two month period following treatment. 
One year later in 2013 only a single experimental animal was captured during surveys, and no *R. sierrae* of any life stage were detected during surveys in 2014 and 2019. 
The one experimental animal recaptured in 2013 was detected during a survey on 26-June, and was a member of the treated group. 
In conclusion, the itraconazole-*J. lividum* exposure did not increase survival sufficiently to allow persistence of this population over the longer-term. 

# Discussion {-}

[e.g., @hardy2015itraconazole; @bosch2015successful; @hudson2016situ; @geiger2017antifungal; @bosch2020significant; @fernandez2020situ]. 

All of the itraconazole treatment experiments, including those with tadpoles, subadults, or adults, produced the desired short-term effect of substantially reducing Bd loads [@garner2009using; @jones2012treatment], often by two or more orders of magnitude. 
In all experiments in which early life stages were treated (Barrett, Dusy), Bd loads remained suppressed during the 1-2 month period following itraconazole treatment, and the reduction in Bd load was associated with increased survival of subadults. 
Unfortunately, this effect was short-lived. 
Bd loads gradually increased following treatment, and within a year Bd loads returned to the high pre-treatment levels typical of those in post-epizootic populations.
Correspondingly, within a year, subadult survival was reduced to zero or near-zero. 
In addition, the short-term increase in subadult survival observed in the 1-2 months immediately following treatment did not translate into an increase in recruitment of new animals into the adult population. 
As such, treatment of early life stages did not affect adult population size or the probability of population persistence, and all study populations were eventually extirpated. 

The itraconazole treatment experiment that focused on adults (LeConte) resulted in Bd load dynamics distinct from those observed in experiments focused on early life stages. 
Specifically, the reduced Bd loads in treated animals were maintained over the three-year duration of the experiment. 
Bd load and survival of treated adults during this period were similar to those of adults in populations that have recovered in the decades following Bd-caused epizootics and subsequent frog die-offs [@joseph2018disease].
However, despite this extended period of reduced Bd loads and increased frog survival, recruitment of new animals into the adult population was notably lacking. 

These observed differences in Bd dynamics in early-stage versus adult frogs are well-known in anurans [@bakar2016susceptibility; @grogan2018review], and are consistent with the idea that given sufficient time, adult MYL frogs can mount a robust acquired immune response against Bd. In turn, this immunity results in long-term suppression of Bd loads and increased adult survival. 
However, we suggest that a similar immune response appears muted or absent in early life stage MYL frogs, as is the case in early life stages of anurans in general [@grogan2018review]. As a result, Bd loads of treated early-stage MYL frogs return to pre-treatment levels relatively quickly. 
Together, these results provide a framework to understand the post-treatment Bd-frog dynamics we observed following antifungal treatment of adults. 
This includes treatment-caused long-lasting reductions of Bd loads in adult frogs (due to acquired immunity), but high Bd loads of progeny at the subadult stage (because of an inability to mount an immune response) that lead to repeated recruitment failure and the eventual decline and extirpation of the population as treated adult frogs succumb to age-induced mortality. 
As such, increasing the survival of young life stages during and after Bd-caused epizootics is clearly essential to the success of any efforts to mitigate the negative effects of Bd on amphibian populations, but as the results of our experiments indicate, this is difficult to accomplish due to the low immunocompetence of early life-stage frogs against Bd [@bakar2016susceptibility].  

The potential constraints on population persistence and recovery posed by the subadult stage was an important motivation for us to conduct the *J. lividum* augmentation experiment. 
Given the low immunocompetence of subadults against Bd, could addition of protective probiotics to the frog skin microbiome reduce frog susceptibility to chytridiomycosis during this vulnerable life stage and increase the survival of subadults to adulthood [@rebollar2020amphibian; @harris2009skin; @bletz2013mitigating]? 
The results from our *J. lividum* augmentation experiment suggest that simply bathing frogs in a solution of *J. lividum*, either as a stand-alone manipulation or following itraconazole treatment to reduce Bd load, is insufficient to provide the long-term protection from Bd infection required to increase subadult survival. 
The rapid decline of *J. lividum* concentrations on frogs in our study population suggests that the frog microbiome is relatively resilient to changes in microbial species composition, and that this is likely to serve as an important impediment to efforts to augment the microbiome with species that might confer increased protection from Bd [@kung2014stability]. 
However, an unexpected outcome of the *J. lividum* experiment was the rapid spread of *J. lividum* from experimental animals to frogs in the study pond at large. These wild frogs quickly developed *J. lividum* concentrations on their skin that were similar to those of animals that were bathed in a concentrated *J. lividum* solution for several hours over a two-day period. 
Although the colonization of wild frogs by *J. lividum* did not appear to confer increased Bd resistance, it does indicate that if an effective probiotic against Bd infection is eventually found, its introduction into a frog population may be as simple as exposing a small number of frogs to the probiotic, and then using these exposed frogs to transmit the microbial agent to the entire frog population.

As described above, the itraconazole treatment of adults conducted in LeConte Basin was relatively effective in facilitating the transition of Bd-frog dynamics from an epizootic to enzootic state. 
However, in contrast to the 47% of treated frogs at LeConte that survived overwinter until the first CMR survey the year after treatment, the Treasure Lake treatment of adults resulted in 0% overwinter survival. Why was the itraconazole treatment of adult frogs in the Treasure Lakes Basin notably less successful? 
The answer is not entirely clear, but one likely reason is that at the time of the treatment the Treasure Lake epizootic was substantially more advanced than was the epizootic in the LeConte Basin. 
As a result, at the start of antifungal treatment the remaining population of adult frogs at Treasure was smaller and surviving individuals captured for treatment had likely suffered the negative effects of chytridiomycosis for a longer period of time than those in LeConte. 
That could have reduced their condition (as measured by energy reserves) and decreased their ability to survive the difficult conditions during winter. 
Whether other factors, such as inherent susceptibility to Bd, were also involved is unknown, but the different outcomes from the LeConte and Treasure experiments suggests the need to conduct treatments before frogs suffer severe effects of chytridiomycosis. 
In addition to the fact that treatment of adults is unlikely to improve the probability of long-term persistence of populations affected by Bd epizootics (at least as judged from the outcome of the LeConte experiment), the need to carefully time when antifungal treatments are conducted is another major challenge associated with conducting adult treatments.
Due to the remoteness of the remaining Bd-naive MYL frog populations, conducting Bd surveillance efforts frequently enough to detect epizootics as they are beginning is difficult at best, and many treatment opportunities are missed as a result. 

In conclusion, targeting Bd mitigation efforts at populations that are Bd-naive or are declining due to ongoing effects of Bd is unlikely to be an effective recovery strategy, even in the short term. 
Instead, whenever possible, such efforts should utilize populations that are robust and have shown substantial recovery in the decades following Bd epizootics. 
Frogs in these populations have likely acquired important adaptations that decrease their Bd susceptibility [@knapp2016large] and that are essential for population establishment. 
Every such population in SEKI, Yosemite, and on surrounding national forests should be used to the maximum extent possible as a source of frogs for future translocations and reintroductions.
Although relatively few such populations exist, they provide the best known opportunity to reestablish extirpated MYL frog populations across their historical range.

Effect of itraconazole treatments on Bd loads of adult *R. sierrae* in the 2015 LeConte treatment experiment: (a) lower basin, and (b) upper basin. The legend for both panels is provided in (b). 
Box plots show Bd loads on frogs in the control (untreated) and treated groups before the treatment began and at the end of the treatment period. 
Control frogs were processed and released before the treatment period, and therefore no Bd samples were collected from control frogs at the end of this period. 
Only frogs that survived to the end of the treatment period and were released back into the study lakes are included. 
The number of frogs in each category are displayed above the x-axis.
Box plot components are as in Figure 1.

Bd loads for adult *R. sierrae* at the Treasure Lake study site before the Bd epizootic (2016-2017), and throughout the 2018 summer when the Bd epizootic began and the antifungal treatment occurred. 
Box colors indicate Bd loads from pre- and post-treatment periods (gray) and during the treatment (blue). 
The number of swabs collected on each date is displayed above the x-axis.
Box plot components are as in Figure 1. 
During the treatment period, individual frogs were swabbed for Bd immediately following their initial capture and again just prior to their release (on 2018-07-23).

For all adult *R. sierrae* in the 2018 Treasure Lakes itraconazole treatment, Bd loads over a two month period that includes the July treatment (16 July to 23 July 2018) and August follow-up surveys. 
Points from the same frog are connected by a line. 
Panel labels are as follows: 1 = frog that died during the treatment ("non-survivor"), 2 = survivor that was not recaptured during the post-release survey in August, and 3 = survivor that was recaptured during the post-release survey. 
The single non-experimental frog captured in August was not included in the treatment (treatment duration = "NA") and is included in panel 1.
