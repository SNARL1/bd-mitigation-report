# Methods {-}

## Validation of the zoospore filtration method {-}

It is common for technical replicates of environmental DNA samples to give variable results due to PCR inhibitors or low quantities of target DNA in samples [@mosher2018beyond]. 
We therefore conducted tests to establish criteria for calling samples Bd-positive or Bd-negative. 
We ran six negative controls (water filter samples from a Bd-naïve pond) on two separate replicate PCR runs, for a  total of 12 PCR reactions, all of which returned Bd-negative data (0 false positive results out of 12 PCR reactions). 
We also ran no template controls in triplicate on every PCR run, with no false positives. 
Therefore, if a sample had at least one positive technical replicate we considered the sample to be positive and calculated the mean across technical replicates after dropping the presumed false negatives. 
To minimize PCR inhibition, we diluted DNA extracts fifty-fold based on pilot tests using undiluted, ten-, fifty-, and one hundred-fold dilutions. 

## *Janthinobacterium lividum* qPCR assay {-}

The *J. lividum* used to develop the real-time PCR assay was a strain provided by Reid Harris, Department of Biology, James Madison University. 
*J. lividum* DNA was extracted from a pure culture of this strain using a Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit following the manufacturer's protocol. 
The DNA collected was amplified using methods in [@harris2009skin]. The PCR product was viewed on a 1% agarose gel, and the 500 bp product was sequenced. 

Primers were designed to be specific to *J. lividum* and sequences were as follows: Jliv_For3 ATGCCACCGACGGCTACCA, and Jliv_Rev1 ACGGCGGGATGGTCATCAC. 
The minor groove binder probe sequence was JLIVT 6FAM AACATCGTTTGCTGTCCGTTGA MGBNFQ. 
After assay optimization, the 25 $\mu$L reaction volumes included 0.5 $\mu$L of each primer at a concentration of 10 $\mu$M, 0.375 $\mu$L of MGB probe at a concentration of 250 nM, 12.5 $\mu$L of Taqman MasterMix (Applied Biosystems), 1.25 $\mu$L BSA, and 5 $\mu$L of template. 
The amplification conditions consisted of an initial cycle of 2 min at 50&deg;C and 10 min at 95&deg;C, followed by 50 cycles at 95&deg;C for 15 s, 58&deg;C for 30 s, and 65&deg;C for 45 s. 
To create standards, DNA was extracted from pure cultures of *J. lividum* with an UltraClean microbial DNA isolation kit (MoBio), and diluted to 10^4^, 10^3^, 10^2^, and 10^1^ *J. lividum* genome equivalents. 
A standard curve was generated for each 96-well plate to estimate the number of *J. lividum* genome equivalents in sample extracts.

## Hidden Markov model for the LeConte treatment experiment {-}

We tracked the fates of individual animals in the LeConte population using a multi-state hidden Markov model. 
We augmented the capture histories of observed animals with a large number of additional capture histories of 
We assumed that the states of individuals are fixed within primary periods, but can change from one primary period to the next. 
States include (1) “not recruited”, (2) “alive at the upper site”, (3) “alive at the lower site”, and (4) “dead”. 
The initial state corresponded to the state at the end of the experiment in 2015, and therefore was known for all experimental animals. 
For example, if an experimental animal was released at the lower site, we knew that the initial state was (3) “alive at the lower site”.

Temporal patterns of Bd infection in the LeConte study populations in the years prior to and the year of the treatment experiment. 
For the lower and upper basins of the study area, Bd prevalence (upper panels) and load (lower panels; on a log10 +1 scale) during the period 2005-2015.
Estimates of average prevalence include Clopper-Pearson binomial 95% confidence intervals and sample sizes. Boxplot components are as in Figure 1. 
Hollow dots overlying the Bd load boxplots represent the actual values (jittered) used to calculate the box plots; Bd load is expressed as log10(copies+1).
